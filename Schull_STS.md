# A Spencer-Brown Inspired Ontological Model of Schull's "Digital Gambling"

This report presents a structured ontological index of Natasha Dow Schull's influential 2005 article "Digital Gambling: The Coincidence of Desire and Design" using Spencer-Brown's calculus of distinctions. By marking entities as distinctions (◻) and relationships as indications (→), we create a formal representation that illuminates the conceptual architecture of how digital gambling technologies produce states of intensive absorption.

## Foundational Entities and Primary Distinctions

### Core Theoretical Constructs

◻ **Digital Gambling**: Schull's 2005 article examining the relationship between gambling interfaces and player experience

◻ **the zone**: Dissociative, trance-like state gamblers enter during machine play

◻ **coincidence of desire and design**: Convergence of gamblers' psychological needs with industry objectives

◻ **machine gambling**: Solitary, screen-based gambling on electronic devices

◻ **digital interface**: Technological mediator between gambler and game algorithm

◻ **gambling addiction**: Compulsive relationship to machine play accelerated by digital design

◻ **extraction of money**: Industry goal facilitated through manipulation of time and space

### Technological Components

◻ **electronic slot machines**: Principal digital gambling interface under study

◻ **video poker**: Screen-based gambling technology examined in the research

◻ **microprocessor**: Computer chip with memory incorporated into gambling machines in 1980s

◻ **hopper**: Electromechanical payout device introduced in 1963

◻ **buttons**: Interface element replacing mechanical levers in video gambling

◻ **screens**: Visual interface replacing physical reels in digital gambling machines

## Morphisms and Relational Structures

### Core Theoretical Relationships

◻ **digital gambling** → *exemplifies* → ◻ **modern capitalism's intensified relation of space, time, and money**
   *"The case of the digital gambling interface exemplifies the tendency of modern capitalism to bring space, time, and money into intensified relation"*

◻ **digital interface** → *facilitates* → ◻ **extreme states of absorption**
   *"Demonstrating the intimate connection between extreme states of subjective absorption in play and design elements"*

◻ **design elements** → *manipulate* → ◻ **space and time**
   *"Design elements that manipulate space and time to accelerate the extraction of money from players"*

◻ **players** → *seek* → ◻ **playing rhythm**
   *"What I want to do is get into my playing rhythm, stay there longer and just play"*

### Technological Development Relationships

◻ **mechanical slot machine** → *was transformed by* → ◻ **electromechanical technology**
   *"The three-reel mechanical slot machine that served as a blueprint for gaming technology since the 1890s was transformed by electromechanical technology in 1963"*

◻ **video games** → *led to replacement of* → ◻ **reels and levers with screens and buttons**
   *"The advent of video games in the 1970s led to the replacement of reels and levers with screens and buttons"*

◻ **digital microprocessor** → *was incorporated to regulate* → ◻ **payout schedule**
   *"In the 1980s, the digital microprocessor (a computer chip with memory) was incorporated into the slot machine as a means of regulating the payout schedule"*

## Complex Conceptual Structures

### The Zone Framework

◻ **the zone** → *is described as* → ◻ **dissociative state**
   *"The Zone: a dissociative, trance-like state where the gambler is so focused on this loop of a dark flow of the game to where everything else fades away"*

◻ **the zone** → *enables* → ◻ **fading away of daily worries and social demands**
   *"In which daily worries, social demands, and even bodily awareness fade away"*

◻ **the zone** → *involves* → ◻ **loss of time and monetary awareness**
   *"Gamblers play not to win but simply to keep playing, for as long as possible–even at the cost of physical and economic exhaustion"*

◻ **gamblers** → *seek* → ◻ **nothingness itself**
   *"People who use slot machines are not trying to get something for nothing. They are trying to get nothingness itself"*

### Design-Desire Framework

◻ **industry** → *seeks* → ◻ **profit**
   *"In continuous machine play, gamblers seek to lose themselves while the gambling industry seeks profit"*

◻ **game algorithms** → *involve* → ◻ **strategic calculations**
   *"Schüll describes the strategic calculations behind game algorithms and machine ergonomics"*

◻ **machine ergonomics** → *facilitate* → ◻ **extended play**
   *"Machines and environments were also designed to keep players in the zone longer, by improving the ergonomics of the machines and chairs"*

◻ **reward schedules** → *are based on* → ◻ **Skinnerian principles**
   *"The algorithms (the math) is what will make them stay (Rewards and reinforcement schedules)"*

### Self-Suspension Framework

◻ **machine play** → *creates* → ◻ **human-machine circuit**
   *"The human and machine in a hermetically closed circuit of action such that the locus of control – and thus, of agency – becomes indiscernible"*

◻ **automagic** → *enables* → ◻ **experience**
   *"The key to the magic is figuring out how to leverage technology to act on customers' preferences [while making] it as invisible – or what I call auto-magic – as possible, to enable experience"*

◻ **machine interface** → *produces* → ◻ **exit from self**
   *"The most extreme of machine gamblers speak in terms of exit... 'I wasn't present – I was gone'"*

◻ **human-machine interaction** → *becomes* → ◻ **fusion**
   *"Conversation gives way to fusion... 'I'm almost hypnotized into being that machine'"*

## Conclusion

This Spencer-Brown inspired ontological model captures the rich theoretical framework of Schull's "Digital Gambling." Through formal distinctions (◻) and indications (→), we visualize how digital gambling interfaces create intense states of absorption through the strategic design of algorithms, interfaces, and environments. The model highlights the convergence between gamblers' desire for self-suspension and the industry's design strategies to maximize time on device and profit extraction. As Schull demonstrates, digital gambling exemplifies broader patterns in modern capitalism, where technologies intensify relationships between space, time, and money to produce specific subjective experiences.
