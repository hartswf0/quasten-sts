# A Spencer-Brown Inspired Ontological Model of Haraway's "Staying with the Trouble"

This report presents a structured ontological index of Donna Haraway's influential 2016 work "Staying with the Trouble: Making Kin in the Chthulucene" using Spencer-Brown's calculus of distinctions. By marking entities as distinctions (◻) and relationships as indications (→), we create a formal representation that illuminates the conceptual architecture of Haraway's response to the ecological and social challenges of our time.

## Foundational Entities and Primary Distinctions

### Core Theoretical Constructs

◻ **Staying with the Trouble**: Haraway's 2016 book on making kinship in complex ecological times

◻ **Chthulucene**: Haraway's proposed alternative to Anthropocene, named for "chthonic ones" of the underearth

◻ **making kin**: Practice of creating relations beyond genealogy and ancestry

◻ **oddkin**: Persons not bounded by ancestry or genealogy, outside normative familial structures

◻ **response-ability**: Capacity for ethically responding to multispecies entanglements

◻ **multispecies cosmopolitics**: Framework for interspecies political engagement

◻ **sympoiesis**: "Making-with" rather than self-making; collective production and becoming

◻ **ongoingness**: Persistence and continuation in the face of devastation

◻ **compost**: Material metaphor for transformation and generative decay

### Key Temporal Frameworks

◻ **Anthropocene**: Epoch defined by human impact on planetary systems

◻ **Capitalocene**: Framework attributing environmental crisis to capitalism

◻ **Plantationocene**: Concept linking current crisis to plantation logics

◻ **n-dimensional time-spaces**: Multiple and diverse temporalities beyond linear progress

### Narrative Entities

◻ **The Camille Stories**: Speculative fiction within the book set from 2025-2425

◻ **Children of Compost**: Future communities imagined in The Camille Stories

◻ **string figures (SF)**: Method connecting storytelling, science fiction, and speculative fabulation

## Morphisms and Relational Structures

### Core Conceptual Relationships

◻ **staying with the trouble** → *requires* → ◻ **making oddkin**
   *"Staying with the trouble requires making oddkin; that is, we require each other in unexpected collaborations and combinations, in hot compost piles"*[4][10]

◻ **staying with the trouble** → *means* → ◻ **being present**
   *"Staying with the trouble requires learning to be truly present, not as a vanishing pivot between awful or Edenic pasts and apocalyptic or salvific futures"*[8]

◻ **staying with the trouble** → *insists on* → ◻ **multispecies cosmopolitics**
   *"'Staying with the Trouble' insists on working, playing and thinking in multispecies cosmopolitics"*[5]

◻ **Chthulucene** → *comes from* → ◻ **Greek roots**
   *"It is a compound of two Greek roots (khthôn and kainos) that together name a kind of timeplace for learning to stay with the trouble"*[11]

◻ **Chthulucene** → *represents* → ◻ **ecological unconscious**
   *"The Chthulucene is like an ecological unconscious, underneath it all but without necessarily being foundational in a teleological sense"*[2]

### Opposition Frameworks

◻ **Haraway** → *rejects* → ◻ **hope and despair**
   *"We know both too much and too little, and so we succumb to despair or to hope, and neither is a sensible attitude"*[11]

◻ **Haraway** → *rejects* → ◻ **technofixes**
   *"Comic faith in technofixes, whether secular or religious: technology will somehow come to the rescue of its naughty but very clever children"*[4]

◻ **Chthulucene** → *challenges* → ◻ **Anthropocene**
   *"Haraway's book can also be thought of as a critique of the Anthropocene as a way of making sense of the present"*[3]

◻ **compost thinking** → *replaces* → ◻ **posthumanist thinking**
   *"Throughout the text Haraway highlights her com-posting approach (compost pile) instead of a posthumanistic approach"*[7]

## Complex Conceptual Structures

### String Figures Framework

◻ **string figures (SF)** → *stand for* → ◻ **multiple connected practices**
   *"SF are productive concepts that enclose action, fabulation and potentialities of entanglements"*[7]

◻ **SF** → *includes* → ◻ **science fiction**
   *"SF are inspired and shaped by different sources"*[7]

◻ **SF** → *includes* → ◻ **speculative fabulation**
   *"SF are inspired and shaped by different sources"*[7]

◻ **SF** → *includes* → ◻ **string figures play**
   *"From Navajo's string figures plays and Hózhó (order, harmonic and right relations of Human and NonHuman)"*[7]

◻ **SF** → *links to* → ◻ **ongoingness**
   *"The metaphor of the SF is linked to the idea of ongoingness"*[7]

### The Camille Stories Framework

◻ **The Camille Stories** → *span* → ◻ **400 years**
   *"Haraway's story covers the life story of five Camilles, from the first born in 2025 to the fifth who dies in 2425"*[12]

◻ **The Camille Stories** → *avoid* → ◻ **definitive ending**
   *"They are openings into other stories, other possibilities for learning to see and so for being rendered responsible"*[6]

◻ **The Camille Stories** → *offer* → ◻ **generative futures**
   *"Good stories reach into rich pasts to sustain thick presents to keep the story going for those who come after"*[6]

### Response-ability Framework

◻ **response-ability** → *engages with* → ◻ **urgency**
   *"How can we think in times of urgencies without the self-indulgent and self-fulfilling myths of apocalypse"*[1]

◻ **response-ability** → *requires* → ◻ **recognizing complicity**
   *"How can we both recognize our complicity in damaging and violent practices while also working to change them?"*[1]

◻ **response-ability** → *aims for* → ◻ **recuperation**
   *"A material and ethical practice that is non-innocent – we must acknowledge our complicity in the Anthropocene – while maintaining that the goal is still recuperation"*[1]

## Theoretical Dimensions

### Multispecies Politics

◻ **chthonic ones** → *include* → ◻ **invertebrates**
   *"Invertibrates of all kinds abound, spiders and octopus especially, but it is bacteria that best embody this"*[2]

◻ **multispecies thinking** → *decenters* → ◻ **human exceptionalism**
   *"De-emphasizing human exceptionalism in favor of multispecism"*[3]

◻ **Chthulucene** → *recognizes* → ◻ **life and death**
   *"Haraway recognizes the Chthulucene as an era for reconsidering life and death"*[7]

◻ **interspecies relations** → *form* → ◻ **symbiotic assemblages**
   *"Using the categories of holobionts and symbionts which like in the case of cyborgs constitutes a new and refreshing ontological proposal"*[12]

### Temporal Dimensions

◻ **Capitalocene and Anthropocene** → *lend themselves to* → ◻ **defeatism**
   *"Both the Anthropocene and the Capitalocene lend themselves too readily to cynicism, defeatism, and self-certain and self-fulfilling predictions"*[6]

◻ **Anthropocene** → *should be* → ◻ **short/thin**
   *"We must imagine the Anthropocene not as an epoch itself but as a geological-historical space we must make as 'short/thin as possible'"*[1]

◻ **becoming-with** → *occurs in* → ◻ **n-dimensional time-spaces**
   *"The entanglements created by becoming-with multiple species aim for the flourishing and the rise of Response-abilities of the multiple entangled species"*[7]

## Conclusion

This Spencer-Brown inspired ontological model captures the rich theoretical framework of Donna Haraway's "Staying with the Trouble." Through formal distinctions (◻) and indications (→), we visualize how Haraway conceptualizes the Chthulucene as an alternative temporal framework that demands response-ability through practices of making kin and staying with difficult realities. The model highlights Haraway's rejection of both easy technofixes and apocalyptic surrender, instead proposing a complex engagement with multispecies entanglements through practices of sympoiesis, string figures, and speculative storytelling exemplified in the Camille Stories. This structured index provides an entry point into Haraway's intricate philosophical response to the planetary challenges of our time.
