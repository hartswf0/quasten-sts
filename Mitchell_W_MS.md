# A Spencer-Brown Inspired Ontological Model of Mitchell's "Picture Theory"

This report presents a structured ontological index of W.J.T. Mitchell's influential 1994 work "Picture Theory: Essays on Verbal and Visual Representation" using Spencer-Brown's calculus of distinctions. By marking entities as distinctions (◻) and relationships as indications (→), we create a formal representation that illuminates the conceptual architecture of Mitchell's theory of pictures and their relationship to language.

## Foundational Entities and Primary Distinctions

### Core Theoretical Constructs

◻ **Picture Theory**: Mitchell's 1994 book examining the interplay between the visible and readable

◻ **pictorial turn**: Shift that supplants the linguistic turn in study of culture; a return to pictures as interplay

◻ **picture**: Concrete object containing images, though category is more complex than initial definition

◻ **image**: Visual representation that appears within a picture 

◻ **metapicture**: Self-referential picture that can theorize its own nature

◻ **word-image relation**: Complex interaction between textual and visual elements

◻ **spectatorship**: The look, gaze, glance, and practices of observation that constitute visual experience

### Representational Domains

◻ **verbal representation**: Meaning-making through textual and linguistic forms

◻ **visual representation**: Meaning-making through images and pictures

◻ **mass media**: Contemporary domain where visual power is increasingly dominant

◻ **literature**: Verbal art form with visual dimensions

◻ **painting**: Visual art form with textual dimensions

◻ **photography**: Medium that combines documentary and aesthetic functions

## Morphisms and Relational Structures

### Foundational Relationships

◻ **pictorial turn** → *follows* → ◻ **linguistic turn**
   *"When the power of the visual is said to be greater than ever before, and the 'pictorial turn' supplants the 'linguistic turn' in the study of culture"[2]*

◻ **picture theory** → *examines* → ◻ **interplay between readable and visible**
   *"This book by one of America's leading theorists of visual representation offers a rich account of the interplay between the visible and the readable across culture"[2]*

◻ **pictures** → *function as* → ◻ **interplay between people, institutions, and looking**
   *"Mitchell argues that we are experiencing a 'pictoral turn' which is actually a return to pictures as an interplay between people, institutions, and looking"[1]*

◻ **pictures** → *can create* → ◻ **their own theory**
   *"Pictures can create their own theory, as in pictures that show images being created like Las Meninas"[1]*

### Conceptual Framework Relationships

◻ **spectatorship** → *is as important as* → ◻ **reading**
   *"It is the realization that spectatorship is as important as reading, and that images are not subservient to text"[1]*

◻ **pictures** → *are never totally separate from* → ◻ **words**
   *"There are no 'pure' arts, and pictures and words, while there are important distinctions between them, words and images are almost never totally separate"[1]*

◻ **images** → *are not* → ◻ **subservient to text**
   *"It is the realization that spectatorship is as important as reading, and that images are not subservient to text"[1]*

◻ **critique** → *combats* → ◻ **surveillance and propaganda images**
   *"He believes that the best way to combat growing surveillance and propaganda images is with critique"[1]*

## Complex Conceptual Structures

### Metapicture Framework

◻ **metapictures** → *theorize* → ◻ **their own nature**
   *"Pictures can create their own theory, as in pictures that show images being created like Las Meninas"[1]*

◻ **metapictures** → *help us* → ◻ **undiscipline ourselves**
   *"If pictures can theorize their own nature, they can also help us to undiscipline ourselves and stop separating words and images"[1]*

◻ **Las Meninas** → *exemplifies* → ◻ **metapicture**
   *"Pictures can create their own theory, as in pictures that show images being created like Las Meninas"[1]*

### Visual-Textual Dynamics Framework

◻ **pictorial turn** → *represents* → ◻ **rediscovery of pictures as figurality**
   *"The pictorial turn is a postlinguistic, postsemiotic rediscovery of the picture as a course, bodies, and figurality"[5]*

◻ **photo essays** → *separate* → ◻ **word and image**
   *"In photo essays that separate word and image and in doing so make sure that one is not seen as subservient to the other"[1]*

◻ **William Blake** → *demonstrates* → ◻ **importance of images as theory**
   *"The importance of images as theory (as opposed to visual language that posits the truth as imageless) can be seen in the work of William Blake"[1]*

### Ethical Framework

◻ **aestheticizing response** → *troubles* → ◻ **documentary representation**
   *"In this chapter on essays, he troubles 'the aestheticizing response to what after all is a real person in desperately impoverished conditions', in reference to Evans' photos of people in the Great Depression"[1]*

◻ **photo essays** → *prevent* → ◻ **complete internalization of subject**
   *"This problem can be subverted by the way image and text are separated in Evans' essay, preventing the reader/viewer from completely internalizing the subject"[1]*

◻ **pictorial turn** → *calls for* → ◻ **new ethical engagement with images**
   *"This strikes the same note as Sontag's thoughts on war photography"[1]*

## Conclusion

This Spencer-Brown inspired ontological model captures the rich theoretical framework of Mitchell's "Picture Theory." Through formal distinctions (◻) and indications (→), we visualize how Mitchell conceptualizes the complex interrelationship between words and images, challenging the hierarchy that often subordinates visual representation to textual meaning. The model highlights his central contribution of the "pictorial turn" as a paradigm shift in cultural theory, where understanding pictures becomes as essential as reading texts. This structured index reveals why Mitchell's work continues to influence our understanding of visual culture and representation across disciplines.
