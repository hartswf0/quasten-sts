# A Spencer-Brown Inspired Ontological Model of Winner's "Do Artifacts Have Politics?"

This report presents a structured ontological index of Langdon Winner's influential 1980 article "Do Artifacts Have Politics?" using Spencer-Brown's calculus of distinctions. By marking entities as distinctions (◻) and relationships as indications (→), we create a formal representation that illuminates the conceptual architecture of how technological artifacts embody political properties.

## Foundational Entities and Primary Distinctions

### Core Theoretical Constructs

◻ **Do Artifacts Have Politics?**: Winner's 1980 article examining political dimensions of technological artifacts

◻ **technological artifacts**: Physical objects, systems, and architectures with political properties

◻ **politics**: Forms of power and authority embedded in technological design and implementation

◻ **technical arrangements as forms of order**: Technologies that establish patterns of human relations

◻ **inherently political technologies**: Technologies requiring or strongly compatible with particular political arrangements

◻ **technological determinism**: View (rejected by Winner) that technologies progress independently of social forces

◻ **social consequences**: Effects of technological artifacts on power relations and social structures

### Two Ways Artifacts Have Politics

◻ **designed political properties**: Artifacts deliberately or inadvertently designed with political implications

◻ **inherent political properties**: Artifacts that by nature require or strongly facilitate certain political arrangements

### Key Examples

◻ **Moses' bridges**: Low overpasses designed to prevent buses carrying minorities from accessing Long Island beaches

◻ **tomato harvester**: Agricultural technology displacing workers and concentrating farming

◻ **McCormick molding machines**: Devices introduced to break union power by replacing skilled workers

◻ **nuclear power**: Energy system requiring centralized, authoritarian control structures

◻ **solar energy**: Technology compatible with more democratic, decentralized arrangements

## Morphisms and Relational Structures

### Foundational Relationships

◻ **technological artifacts** → *can embody* → ◻ **political arrangements**
   *"Technical things have political qualities"*[1][3]

◻ **artifacts** → *can settle* → ◻ **affairs of a community**
   *"The invention, design, or arrangement of artifacts becomes a mechanism for settling the affairs of a community"*[4]

◻ **technological choices** → *are* → ◻ **political choices**
   *"Decisions about what systems to build and how to build them become political decisions"*[9]

◻ **social consequences** → *can arise from* → ◻ **technological arrangements**
   *"Technical arrangements can be used in ways that enhance the power, authority, and privilege of some over others"*[9]

### Design Politics Framework

◻ **Moses' bridges** → *were designed to* → ◻ **exclude minorities and poor people**
   *"Moses built his overpasses according to specifications that would discourage the presence of buses on his parkways"*[10]

◻ **technical specifications** → *can encode* → ◻ **social specifications**
   *"Bridge-building is social engineering, because power relations can literally be built into and perpetuated through stone"*[8]

◻ **technological design** → *can produce* → ◻ **social impacts beyond original use**
   *"Both encompassed purposes far beyond their original use"*[9]

◻ **technological development** → *can be* → ◻ **biased in a particular direction**
   *"Instances in which the very process of technical development is so thoroughly biased in a particular direction"*[4]

## Complex Conceptual Structures

### Technology-Politics Matrix

◻ **inherently political technologies** → *vary along axis of* → ◻ **requirement versus compatibility**
   *"Inherently political technologies are graded along the two axes of 'strict requirement versus strong compatibility' with social relations"*[8]

◻ **inherently political technologies** → *vary along axis of* → ◻ **internal versus external conditions**
   *"Conditions 'internal versus external' to the workings of a given technology"*[8]

◻ **nuclear power** → *strictly requires* → ◻ **authoritarian political structure**
   *"Such a dangerous technology requires a strict militaristic government in place to manage and enforce strict regulation"*[9]

◻ **solar energy** → *is strongly compatible with* → ◻ **democratic structures**
   *"Solar energy systems are more compatible with democratic, decentralized structures"*[9]

### Unintended Consequences Framework

◻ **tomato harvester** → *led to* → ◻ **agricultural concentration**
   *"Led to tomato farming becoming concentrated around larger farms, and changing the lives of many tomato workers profoundly"*[11]

◻ **McCormick machines** → *were introduced to* → ◻ **break union power**
   *"The true reason however was to break up the National Union of Iron Molders"*[9]

◻ **social consequences** → *can be* → ◻ **intended or unintended**
   *"Transcends the simple categories of 'intended' and 'unintended' altogether"*[4]

### Technological Order Framework

◻ **technologies** → *are ways of* → ◻ **building order in our world**
   *"The things we call 'technologies' are ways of building order in our world"*[11]

◻ **technologies** → *can become* → ◻ **part of the landscape**
   *"Relationships among people that, after a time, became just another part of the landscape"*[10]

◻ **technological assessment** → *should consider* → ◻ **many consequences**
   *"We should 'achieve a clearer view' of technological innovation and consider its many consequences"*[11]

## Conclusion

This Spencer-Brown inspired ontological model captures the rich theoretical framework of Winner's "Do Artifacts Have Politics?" Through formal distinctions (◻) and indications (→), we visualize how Winner conceptualizes technological artifacts as inherently political entities that can embody power relations through both deliberate design choices and inherent requirements. The model highlights Winner's two key arguments: that artifacts can be designed (intentionally or unintentionally) to have political effects, and that certain technologies inherently require or strongly favor particular political arrangements. This structured index reveals Winner's profound contribution to our understanding of the political dimensions of technology and the impossibility of separating technological choices from their social consequences.
