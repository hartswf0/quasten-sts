# A Spencer-Brown Inspired Ontological Model of Suchman's "Human-Machine Reconfigurations"

This report presents a structured ontological index of Lucy Suchman's influential 2007 work "Human-Machine Reconfigurations: Plans and Situated Actions" using Spencer-Brown's calculus of distinctions. By marking entities as distinctions (◻) and relationships as indications (→), we create a formal representation that illuminates the conceptual architecture of Suchman's ethnomethodological approach to human-machine interaction.

## Foundational Entities and Primary Distinctions

### Core Theoretical Constructs

◻ **Human-Machine Reconfigurations**: Suchman's 2007 expanded edition of her 1987 book

◻ **plans**: Representations or abstractions of action, often misconstrued as controlling structures

◻ **situated actions**: Actions taken in response to local circumstances and contingencies

◻ **human-machine communication**: Interactive processes between humans and technological systems

◻ **ethnomethodology**: Analytical approach examining how social order is produced through everyday practices

◻ **plans as resources**: Reconceptualization of plans as resources for action rather than determining scripts

◻ **interactive artifacts**: Machines designed to exhibit interactive behaviors with humans

### Key Components and Case Study Elements

◻ **Xerox photocopier**: Primary technological artifact in Suchman's empirical study

◻ **expert help system**: Interface designed to provide guidance to photocopier users

◻ **story scene**: Particular setting where interaction occurs between humans and machines

◻ **design rationale**: Underlying logic informing the creation of interactive systems

◻ **users**: People attempting to operate technological systems

◻ **collaborative sense-making**: Process through which humans establish shared understanding

## Morphisms and Relational Structures

### Foundational Relationships

◻ **plans** → *are reconceptualized as* → ◻ **resources for action**
   *"For situated action, however, the vagueness of plans is ideally suited to the fact that the detail of intent and action must be contingent on the circumstantial and interactional particulars of actual situations"*

◻ **traditional AI** → *treats* → ◻ **plans as controlling structures**
   *"I examine an artifact built on a planning model of human action. The model treats a plan as something located in the actor's head, which directs his/her behavior"*

◻ **situated actions** → *depend on* → ◻ **local circumstances**
   *"I argue that artifacts built on the planning model confuse plans with situated actions"*

◻ **human action** → *is* → ◻ **contingent and circumstantial**
   *"The detail of intent and action must be contingent on the circumstantial and interactional particulars of actual situations"*

### Communication and Interaction Framework

◻ **human-machine communication** → *involves* → ◻ **fundamental asymmetries**
   *"Comparing the interactional resources of user and machine reveals a fundamental asymmetry in the available means by which each produces and construes the features of their shared situation"*

◻ **machine** → *has access to* → ◻ **limited actions of users**
   *"The richest source of information for me, as a full-fledged 'intelligent' observer, was the talk, recorded in Column I... one could clearly see the very small subset, recorded in Column II, that were actually detected by the system"*

◻ **human conversation** → *includes* → ◻ **rich array of interactional competencies**
   *"Humans dynamically coconstruct the mutual intelligibility of a conversation through an extraordinarily rich array of embodied interactional competencies"*

◻ **human-machine interaction** → *is not* → ◻ **similar to human-human interaction**
   *"Human-machine interaction is less a matter of simulating human communication, than of engineering alternatives to talk's situated properties"*

## Complex Conceptual Structures

### Human-Machine Asymmetry Framework

◻ **machine** → *interprets actions through* → ◻ **planning model**
   *"The system must in some sense be able to find that action's significance. To handle the problem of action interpretation, the designer of this machine adopts the view, common to the cognitive sciences, that the source of the order of situated actions is a cognitive structure – in this case a plan"*

◻ **users** → *rely on* → ◻ **situated competencies**
   *"This isn't a problem for human actors, who rely on a range of ordinary (or extraordinary) competencies to bring plans into relation with the circumstances of action"*

◻ **machine interpretation** → *sees user's actions as* → ◻ **"through a pinhole"**
   *"From the machine's 'point of view,' one could see how it was that those available traces of the user's actions – the user's actions seen, as it were, through a pin-hole"*

◻ **users** → *experience* → ◻ **communication breakdowns**
   *"This comparison located precisely the points of confusion"*

### Implementation Framework

◻ **plan implementation** → *is always* → ◻ **situated activity**
   *"Even in cases where everything does go 'according to plan,' the implementation of a plan is always, and necessarily, a situated activity not fully specified in the plan itself"*

◻ **plans** → *presuppose* → ◻ **unspecified competencies**
   *"Every plan presupposes capacities of cognition and (inter)action that are not, and cannot ever be, fully specified"*

◻ **computational machines** → *face* → ◻ **profound unsolved problem**
   *"But it is a profound, and unsolved, problem for computational machines"*

◻ **remedying breakdown** → *is essential to* → ◻ **human communication**
   *"The remedying of trouble and continual repair are essential to human communication"*

## Theoretical Evolution and Extensions

### From 1987 to 2007 Framework

◻ **original 1987 book** → *is expanded in* → ◻ **2007 edition**
   *"In Human-Machine Reconfigurations I revisit these arguments through an annotated version of the original text, reframed by a series of new chapters"*

◻ **2007 edition** → *considers* → ◻ **developments in AI, HCI, and STS**
   *"The new chapters provide an opportunity to update both theoretical resources and empirical examples"*

◻ **agencies** → *are reconfigured at* → ◻ **human-machine interface**
   *"My aim in this book is to rethink the intricate, and increasingly intimate, configurations of the human and the machine"*

◻ **Suchman's research** → *influences* → ◻ **human-computer interaction field**
   *"Lucy Suchman's Plans and Situated Actions (1987) was a huge influence on the fields of human-computer interaction and computer-supported cooperative work"*

### Contemporary Theoretical Framework

◻ **the question** → *shifts from* → ◻ **human-machine sameness/difference**
   *"The question for this book shifts from one of whether humans and machines are the same or different to how and when the categories of human or machine become relevant"*

◻ **Suchman** → *draws on* → ◻ **feminist science studies**
   *"The latter has involved encounters since the 1980s with feminist science studies"*

◻ **agential boundaries** → *are enacted through* → ◻ **practices**
   *"How relations of sameness or difference between them are enacted on particular occasions, and with what discursive and material consequences"*

◻ **reconfiguration** → *requires* → ◻ **expanded unit of analysis**
   *"This requires expanding our unit of analysis, while recognizing the inevitable cuts or boundaries through which technological systems are constituted"*

## Conclusion

This Spencer-Brown inspired ontological model captures the rich theoretical framework of Suchman's "Human-Machine Reconfigurations." Through formal distinctions (◻) and indications (→), we visualize how Suchman reconceptualizes the relationship between plans and situated actions, challenging the dominant cognitive science model that treats plans as controlling structures. The model highlights the fundamental asymmetries between human and machine interaction and reveals why seemingly "intelligent" interfaces often fail to facilitate effective communication. Suchman's work continues to be relevant to understanding human-machine interaction, demonstrating how technological design must account for the situated, contingent nature of human activity rather than relying on abstract planning models.
