# A Spencer-Brown Inspired Ontological Model of Manovich's "The Language of New Media"

This report presents a structured ontological index of Lev Manovich's influential 2001 work "The Language of New Media" using Spencer-Brown's calculus of distinctions. By marking entities as distinctions (◻) and relationships as indications (→), we create a formal representation that illuminates the conceptual architecture of Manovich's theory of new media.

## Foundational Entities and Primary Distinctions

### Core Theoretical Constructs

◻ **The Language of New Media**: Manovich's 2001 book examining principles of new media

◻ **new media**: Digital media characterized by numerical encoding and computational manipulation

◻ **cultural layer**: Content and form derived from cultural traditions and conventions

◻ **computer layer**: Computational structures, processes, and affordances underlying new media

◻ **numerical representation**: Digital encoding of media into mathematical data

◻ **metamedium**: Computer as universal media machine capable of simulating all previous media

◻ **database**: Structured collection of data representing core ontology of computer age

◻ **algorithmic manipulation**: Programmatic transformations of digital content

### Media Principles and Properties

◻ **modularity**: Fractal structure of new media where elements maintain independence within larger objects

◻ **automation**: Partial removal of human intentionality from creative process

◻ **variability**: Existence of media in potentially infinite different versions

◻ **cultural transcoding**: Transfer between cultural conventions and computer conventions

◻ **interface**: Software layer mediating between humans and encoded data

◻ **interactivity**: User's ability to directly manipulate and transform media content

### Historical Components

◻ **cinema**: Key predecessor medium providing conventions that structure new media

◻ **avant-garde film**: Artistic tradition appropriated and hardcoded in software interfaces

◻ **print**: Earlier medium whose conventions inform screen-based interfaces

◻ **Dziga Vertov**: Filmmaker whose work anticipates database aesthetic of new media

◻ **A Man with a Movie Camera**: Film exemplifying database as symbolic form

◻ **photography**: Predecessor medium whose attributes are simulated in new media

## Morphisms and Relational Structures

### Foundational Relationships

◻ **new media** → *consists of* → ◻ **cultural layer and computer layer**
   *"Manovich suggests thinking of new media as 'two distinct layers – the cultural layer and the computer layer'"*[1]

◻ **computer** → *functions as* → ◻ **metamedium**
   *"The computer, viewed as a medium itself, can be all other media if the embedding and viewing methods are sufficiently well provided"*[10]

◻ **database** → *replaces* → ◻ **narrative as cultural form**
   *"Along with Greenaway, Dziga Vertov can be thought of as a major 'database filmmaker' of the twentieth century"*[10][12]

◻ **cinema** → *provides* → ◻ **interface conventions to new media**
   *"To summarize, the visual culture of a computer age is cinematographic in its appearance, digital on the level of its material"*[8]

### New Media Principles Framework

◻ **numerical representation** → *enables* → ◻ **algorithmic manipulation**
   *"If all existing media is translated to numerical data that is accessible for the computer then graphics, sounds, shapes, spaces, moving images, and texts are computable"*[4]

◻ **modularity** → *allows* → ◻ **discrete elements to maintain independence**
   *"These collections of discrete samples (pixels, characters, and scripts) have the same modular structure. Thus, they maintain their separate identities when assembled into larger-scale objects"*[4]

◻ **automation** → *results from* → ◻ **numerical representation and modularity**
   *"Automation being both numerical representation and modularity allows for manipulation and access"*[4]

◻ **variability** → *creates* → ◻ **multiple versions of same work**
   *"Numerical representation as described by Manovich is all new media objects composed of a digital code regardless of it was initially created on a computer or converted from analog media sources resulting in individual customization not mass standardization"*[4]

## Complex Conceptual Structures

### Cultural Transcoding Framework

◻ **cultural transcoding** → *produces* → ◻ **hybrid computer/human structures**
   *"The computerization of culture gradually accomplishes similar transcoding in relation to all cultural categories and concepts"*[10]

◻ **human categories** → *are remapped to* → ◻ **computational categories**
   *"Paradoxically, Manovich's importation of computer science into cultural studies marks the most important shift in cultural studies in at least a decade"*[8]

◻ **interface** → *mediates between* → ◻ **cultural and computational layers**
   *"Manovich places new media within the histories of visual and media cultures of the last few centuries. He discusses new media's reliance on conventions of old media"*[5]

◻ **avant-garde** → *becomes embedded in* → ◻ **software commands**
   *"One general effect of the digital revolution is that avant-garde aesthetic strategies came to be embedded in the commands and interface metaphors of computer software. In short, the avant-garde became materialized in a computer"*[8]

### Database-Narrative Framework

◻ **database** → *exists in tension with* → ◻ **narrative**
   *"Vertov is able to achieve something which new media designers and artists still have to learn — how to merge database and narrative merge into a new form"*[10][12]

◻ **database film** → *presents* → ◻ **items without privileged order**
   *"Man with a Movie Camera is perhaps the most important example of database imagination in modern media art"*[10][12]

◻ **database** → *represents* → ◻ **world as list of items**
   *"A Man with a Movie Camera is not only a database of city life in the 1920s, a database of film techniques, and a database of new operations of visual epistemology"*[12]

◻ **narrative** → *competes with* → ◻ **database**
   *"Vertov's film has a particular relevance to new media. It proves that it is possible to turn 'effects' into a meaningful artistic language"*[10][12]

## Technological Evolution Framework

### Digital Cinema Framework

◻ **synthetic image** → *represents* → ◻ **different reality**
   *"Synthetic computer-generated image is not an inferior representation of our reality, but a realistic representation of a different reality"*[10][12]

◻ **digital cinema** → *transforms* → ◻ **indexical media to painting**
   *"Whose vision is it? It is the vision of a computer, a cyborg, a automatic missile"*[10][12]

◻ **realistic media** → *becomes* → ◻ **subset of painterly media**
   *"New visual media achieve their cultural significance precisely by paying homage to, rivaling, and refashioning such earlier media as perspective painting, photography, film, and television"*[5]

◻ **cinema** → *undergoes* → ◻ **digital materialization**
   *"The visual culture of a computer age is cinematographic in its appearance, digital on the level of its material"*[8]

## Conclusion

This Spencer-Brown inspired ontological model captures the rich theoretical framework of Manovich's "The Language of New Media." Through formal distinctions (◻) and indications (→), we visualize how Manovich conceptualizes new media as a hybrid of cultural and computational logics. The model highlights his five key principles—numerical representation, modularity, automation, variability, and cultural transcoding—while demonstrating the unique position of new media between cinematic history and computational future. By mapping these relationships, we gain insight into Manovich's influential analysis of how digital media transforms cultural forms and practices through computational processes.
