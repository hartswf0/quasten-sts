# A Spencer-Brown Inspired Ontological Model of Edwards' "A Vast Machine"

This report presents a structured ontological index of Paul N. Edwards' influential 2010 work "A Vast Machine: Computer Models, Climate Data, and the Politics of Global Warming" using Spencer-Brown's calculus of distinctions. By marking entities as distinctions (◻) and relationships as indications (→), we create a formal representation that illuminates the conceptual architecture of climate knowledge infrastructure.

## Foundational Entities and Primary Distinctions

### Core Theoretical Constructs

◻ **vast machine**: Edwards' metaphor for the global sociotechnical system of climate knowledge production

◻ **knowledge infrastructure**: The robust networks of people, artifacts, and institutions that generate knowledge

◻ **climate data**: Records of atmospheric conditions derived from instrumental observations

◻ **climate models**: Computer simulations representing atmospheric and oceanic physics

◻ **global data**: Information standardized, homogenized, and integrated into worldwide datasets

◻ **data friction**: The costs in time, energy, and attention required to collect, check, store, and transmit data

◻ **infrastructural globalism**: The worldview that conceptualizes planet Earth as a knowable entity

### Historical and Institutional Entities

◻ **World Meteorological Organization (WMO)**: International body coordinating global weather observation

◻ **International Geophysical Year (IGY)**: 1957-1958 scientific project that catalyzed global data collection

◻ **Global Observing System**: WMO-coordinated network of observation platforms

◻ **General Circulation Models (GCMs)**: Computer simulations modeling global atmospheric circulation

◻ **Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)**: Body assessing climate science for policymakers

## Conclusion

This Spencer-Brown inspired ontological model captures the rich theoretical framework of Edwards' "A Vast Machine." Through formal distinctions (◻) and indications (→), we visualize how climate knowledge emerges from the complex interaction between observations and models within a vast sociotechnical infrastructure. The model highlights Edwards' central insight: that our understanding of climate change depends fundamentally on the infrastructure that makes global data possible, and that this infrastructure both enables and constrains what we can know about our changing planet.
