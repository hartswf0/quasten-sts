# A Spencer-Brown Inspired Ontological Model of Sutton-Smith's "The Ambiguity of Play"

This report presents a structured ontological index of Brian Sutton-Smith's influential 1997 work "The Ambiguity of Play" using Spencer-Brown's calculus of distinctions. By marking entities as distinctions (◻) and relationships as indications (→), we create a formal representation that illuminates the conceptual architecture of Sutton-Smith's analysis of play's fundamental ambiguity.

## Foundational Entities and Primary Distinctions

### Core Theoretical Constructs

◻ **The Ambiguity of Play**: Sutton-Smith's 1997 book examining multiple theoretical approaches to play

◻ **play**: Activity characterized by multiple meanings, forms, and interpretations

◻ **ambiguity**: Quality of play that makes it resistant to fixed meaning and definition

◻ **rhetoric**: Persuasive discourse or implicit narrative adopted by members of a particular affiliation

◻ **play theory**: Scholarly attempts to define and understand play's nature and functions

◻ **variability**: Adaptive flexibility within both play forms and scholarly interpretations

◻ **play scholarship**: Academic approaches to play across multiple disciplines

### Seven Rhetorics of Play

◻ **progress rhetoric**: View of play as adaptation and essential for development (modern)

◻ **fate rhetoric**: View of play as existential optimism involving chance and divination (ancient)

◻ **power rhetoric**: View of play as contest and strategy for establishing superiority (ancient)

◻ **identity rhetoric**: View of play as reinforcing communal bonds and identity (ancient)

◻ **imaginary rhetoric**: View of play as transformation and creativity (modern)

◻ **self rhetoric**: View of play as peak experience and individuality (modern)

◻ **frivolity rhetoric**: View of play as inversion, absurdity, and the carnivalesque (ancient)

## Morphisms and Relational Structures

### Foundational Relationships

◻ **play** → *resists* → ◻ **fixed meaning**
   *"Something about the nature of play itself frustrates fixed meaning"*[9]

◻ **ambiguity** → *exists in* → ◻ **seven types**
   *"Before unpacking 'play,' Sutton-Smith clarifies the very meaning of 'ambiguity,' invoking William Empson's Seven Types of Ambiguity (1955)"*[1]

◻ **play** → *is ambiguous in* → ◻ **reference, referent, intent, sense, transition, contradiction, and meaning**
   *"Play could be ambiguous in terms of reference, referent, intent, sense, transition, contradiction, and meaning"*[1]

◻ **rhetorics** → *function as* → ◻ **persuasive discourses**
   *"The word rhetoric is used here in its modern sense, as being a persuasive discourse, or an implicit narrative, wittingly or unwittingly adopted by members of a particular affiliation to persuade others of the veracity and worthwhileness of their beliefs"*[3]

### Rhetoric Framework Relationships

◻ **progress rhetoric** → *associates play with* → ◻ **learning and development**
   *"Play is viewed as an adaptation, as progressive, and as essential for learning, for acquiring skills and socialization, and for development of the brain, cognition, and emotion"*[2]

◻ **fate rhetoric** → *associates play with* → ◻ **chance and divination**
   *"Play is viewed as existential optimism. Play has a dark side associated with animism, divination, magic, chance, chaos, unrealistic expectations, and psychic masochism. Gamblers are the typical players"*[2]

◻ **power rhetoric** → *associates play with* → ◻ **contests and victory**
   *"Play involves strategy and skill games, with the ends being victory and enhanced status"*[2]

◻ **identity rhetoric** → *associates play with* → ◻ **communal bonding**
   *"Play involves symbolic interaction, bonding, communal life, and such rituals as parades, festivals, parties, theatrical performances, political gatherings, and religious services"*[2]

## Complex Conceptual Structures

### Disciplinary Framework

◻ **multiple disciplines** → *approach* → ◻ **play differently**
   *"An understanding of play's ambiguity requires the help of multiple disciplines"*[3]

◻ **biology** → *focuses on* → ◻ **adaptive value of play**
   *"Most biological, psychological, and educational notions about play, and their authors, fall into this camp"*[2]

◻ **psychology** → *applies* → ◻ **progress rhetoric predominantly**
   *"The progress rhetoric of play, primarily within the discipline of developmental psychology and education"*[1]

◻ **anthropology** → *studies* → ◻ **identity rhetoric in cultural contexts**
   *"Its origins lie in anthropology and folklore traditions, with the general public the primary players"*[2]

### Forms of Play Framework

◻ **play forms** → *include* → ◻ **multiple categories**
   *"Within an array of play forms and experiences, object play has a place in each sphere Sutton-Smith outlines"*[1]

◻ **play categories** → *include* → ◻ **mind play, solitary play, social play, audience play, performance play, celebrations, contests, and risky play**
   *"Examples of play activities can be categorized as: mind or subjective play; solitary play; playful behaviors; informal social play; vicarious audience play; performance play; celebrations and festivals; contests; and risky or deep play"*[11]

◻ **temporal diversity** → *characterizes* → ◻ **play forms**
   *"This diversity is temporal (e.g. duration, frequency, spontaneity) as well as spatial"*[1]

◻ **spatial diversity** → *characterizes* → ◻ **play forms**
   *"This diversity is temporal as well as spatial (e.g. domestic, public, international)"*[1]

### Evolutionary Function Framework

◻ **play** → *provides* → ◻ **adaptive variability**
   *"In my own work I have emphasized play as adaptive potentiation or adaptive variability (1997)"*[2]

◻ **play** → *functions as* → ◻ **viability variable**
   *"The author covers the development of his three major theories of play—as a viability variable, as culturally relative play forms, and as a co-evolutionary multiplex of functions"*[13]

◻ **play** → *creates* → ◻ **mental feedback**
   *"As a form of mental feedback, play might nullify the rigidity that sets in after successful adaption, thus reinforcing animal and human variability"*[4]

◻ **play** → *reinforces* → ◻ **variability for natural selection**
   *"Sutton-Smith suggests that play might provide a model of the variability that allows for 'natural' selection"*[4]

## Conclusion

This Spencer-Brown inspired ontological model captures the rich theoretical framework of Sutton-Smith's "The Ambiguity of Play." Through formal distinctions (◻) and indications (→), we visualize how Sutton-Smith conceptualizes play as fundamentally ambiguous, approached through seven distinct rhetorics tied to different disciplines, historical traditions, and scholarly communities. The model highlights his analysis of how these rhetorics reveal the profound variability of play, suggesting its evolutionary function in promoting adaptive flexibility. This structured index provides insight into why play resists fixed definition while remaining universally recognizable across human cultures and even animal species.
