# A Spencer-Brown Inspired Ontological Model of María Puig de la Bellacasa's "Matters of Care"

This report presents a structured ontological framework for María Puig de la Bellacasa's influential work "Matters of Care: Speculative Ethics in More Than Human Worlds" using Spencer-Brown's calculus of distinctions. By marking entities as distinctions (◻) and relationships as indications (→), we create a formal representation of the book's conceptual architecture that illuminates its key contributions to care ethics, posthumanism, and science and technology studies.

## Foundational Entities and Primary Distinctions

### Core Conceptual Distinctions

◻ **matters of care**: The central theoretical contribution that extends beyond matters of concern

◻ **care**: A multidimensional concept described as "everything that we do to maintain, continue and repair 'our world' so that we can live in it as well as possible"[1][2]

◻ **speculative ethics**: An approach that engages with possible futures and alternative modes of relating

◻ **more-than-human worlds**: The expanded ontological terrain where human and non-human agencies intertwine

◻ **matters of concern**: Bruno Latour's concept describing actively contested and constructed knowledge[1]

◻ **matters of fact**: Ostensibly settled knowledge that Latour distinguishes from matters of concern[1]

### Dimensional Distinctions of Care

◻ **labor/work dimension**: The material practices involved in actualizing care[2]

◻ **affect/affections dimension**: The emotional and relational aspects of care[2]

◻ **ethics/politics dimension**: The normative commitments and power relations in care practices[2]

◻ **maintenance practices**: The concrete activities involved in sustaining worlds[1][2]

◻ **interdependency**: The ontological condition of mutual reliance between entities[2]

## Morphisms and Relational Structures

### Transformative Relations

◻ **matters of concern** → *transforms into* → ◻ **matters of care**
   *Extending Latour's concept by adding an ethic of care*[1][3]

◻ **care** → *encompasses* → ◻ **labor/work**
   *Care includes material practices of maintenance*[2]

◻ **care** → *encompasses* → ◻ **affect/affections**
   *Care involves emotional and relational engagement*[2]

◻ **care** → *encompasses* → ◻ **ethics/politics**
   *Care entails normative commitments and power relations*[2]

◻ **human agency** → *expands to* → ◻ **more-than-human agency**
   *Care ethics extends beyond human-centered frameworks*[1][11]

### Knowledge Production Relations

◻ **thinking-with** → *is a mode of* → ◻ **caring scholarship**
   *Scholars engage in uneasy but committed dialogues with conflicting ideas*[1]

◻ **dissenting-within** → *is a mode of* → ◻ **caring scholarship**
   *Critical engagement through appropriation, redirection, and reworking*[1]

◻ **speaking-for** → *is a mode of* → ◻ **caring scholarship**
   *Acknowledging the displacement of voice when adopting marginalized perspectives*[1]

◻ **touching vision** → *reorients* → ◻ **ways of knowing**
   *Vision becomes sensitive to its vulnerable, subjective and relational grounding*[1]

## Complex Conceptual Structures

### The Touch Complex

◻ **touch** → *enables* → ◻ **mutual knowing**
   *What is learned through touch depends on the response of the other being touched*[1]

◻ **touch** → *confounds* → ◻ **subject-object distinctions**
   *Touch flows in both directions—what we touch touches us as well*[1]

◻ **touch** → *transforms* → ◻ **vision**
   *Creates a form of seeing sensitive to its own vulnerability and relationality*[1]

### The Alterbiopolitics Framework

◻ **alterbiopolitics** → *displaces* → ◻ **individual ethics**
   *When self-sustenance and collective outcomes are entangled, individual/collective distinctions break down*[1]

◻ **permaculture** → *informs* → ◻ **alterbiopolitics**
   *Practical experiences of interdependency inform collective modes of ethics*[1][13]

◻ **alterbiopolitics** → *emerges from* → ◻ **everyday relationships**
   *Ethics emerges speculatively out of the mutuality of everyday relationships*[1]

### Care Temporality Complex

◻ **soil care** → *exemplifies* → ◻ **care temporalities**
   *Care for soil involves slow, unfolding temporalities*[1]

◻ **care temporalities** → *contrast with* → ◻ **technological futures**
   *Care temporalities differ from rapid, innovation-driven imaginaries*[1]

◻ **speculative commitment** → *prevents reduction of* → ◻ **natural entities to resources**
   *Attention to unfolding temporalities resists objectification*[1]

## Ethical and Epistemological Extensions

### Care Beyond Anthropocentrism

◻ **care** → *extends to* → ◻ **non-human others**
   *Care attunes us to the care-like work done by non-human others*[1]

◻ **anthropomorphism** → *becomes productive as* → ◻ **speculative move**
   *Imagining non-human others as caring pays attention to their particularity*[1]

◻ **care ethics** → *bridges* → ◻ **posthumanism**
   *Care ethics connects with posthumanist perspectives while maintaining feminist commitments*[5][13]

## Conclusion

This Spencer-Brown inspired ontological model captures the rich conceptual architecture of Puig de la Bellacasa's "Matters of Care." Through formal distinctions (◻) and indications (→), we can visualize how the book extends care ethics beyond human-centered frameworks while maintaining its feminist grounding. The model highlights the book's central contribution: transforming matters of concern into matters of care through speculative ethics that attend to interdependency in more-than-human worlds.

This structured representation demonstrates how Puig de la Bellacasa's work bridges care ethics, science and technology studies, and posthumanism to develop a framework for ethical engagement that is simultaneously material, affective, and political—opening new possibilities for thinking about and practicing care in complex technoscientific worlds.
