# A Spencer-Brown Inspired Ontological Model of "Feminist Technology"

This report presents a structured ontological index of "Feminist Technology" (2010) edited by Linda L. Layne, Sharra L. Vostral, and Kate Boyer using Spencer-Brown's calculus of distinctions. By marking entities as distinctions (◻) and relationships as indications (→), we create a formal representation that illuminates the conceptual architecture of feminist approaches to technological design, assessment, and use.

## Foundational Entities and Primary Distinctions

### Core Theoretical Constructs

◻ **Feminist Technology**: The 2010 collected volume examining technologies designed for women

◻ **feminist technology**: Conceptualized as tools plus knowledge that enhance women's capacities

◻ **technology**: Defined as "tools plus knowledge that enhance and extend our human capacities"[5]

◻ **feminism**: Political movement that seeks to empower women

◻ **empowerment**: Giving women more power over their lives

◻ **liberation**: Freedom from constraints, often claimed in marketing but requiring scrutiny

◻ **feminine technology**: Technologies associated with women by virtue of their biology

### Core Questions Explored

◻ **feminist technology question**: "Is there such a thing as a 'feminist technology'?"[1][5][6]

◻ **design question**: Is feminist technology in the design process?

◻ **artifact question**: Is feminist technology in the thing itself?

◻ **marketing question**: Is feminist technology in the way it is marketed?

◻ **use question**: Is feminist technology in the way it is used by women (or men)?

## Morphisms and Relational Structures

### Definitional Relationships

◻ **feminist technology** → *is defined as* → ◻ **tools plus knowledge that enhance women's capacities**
   *"A working definition of 'feminist technology' would be those tools plus knowledge that enhance women's ability to develop, expand, and express their capacities"*[5]

◻ **feminist technology** → *is not equivalent to* → ◻ **feminine technology**
   *"By no means do we equate 'feminine technologies' with 'feminist' ones"*[5]

◻ **feminist technologies** → *must* → ◻ **empower women**
   *"Feminist technologies must 'empower women,' but we soon realized this was not as simple a criterion as it first seemed"*[5]

◻ **women** → *are not* → ◻ **homogeneous group**
   *"Women are not the same. Must a feminist technology empower all women? Most women? What if a technology empowers some women and disempowers others?"*[5]

### Marketing-Reality Disjunction

◻ **liberatory marketing claims** → *do not necessarily make* → ◻ **feminist technology**
   *"At this point we knew that marketing a product as liberatory for women does not make it so"*[5]

◻ **feminist washing** → *resembles* → ◻ **green washing**
   *"These might be considered examples of 'feminist washing,' akin to 'green washing'"*[5]

◻ **feminizing technology** → *often produces* → ◻ **anti-feminist technology**
   *"Feminizing an existing technology did not make it feminist, but often just the opposite"*[5]

## Complex Conceptual Structures

### Problematic Design Frameworks

◻ **shrink it and pink it** → *is* → ◻ **misguided approach**
   *"Much of the innovation recently directed toward women has been of this kind: based on a 'shrink it and pink it' approach that, as cultural anthropologist Genevieve Bell of Intel observes, is 'profoundly misguided'"*[5]

◻ **male-defined feminine aesthetic** → *can produce* → ◻ **anti-feminist technology**
   *"If this technology reinforces a gender system in which women's aesthetic has been defined by men to suit men's interests and are antithetical to women's interest and goals, then the designers and manufacturers have certainly not produced a feminist technology, and indeed may have produced an anti-feminist technology"*[5]

◻ **adapting male technology for women** → *may* → ◻ **perpetuate gender gap**
   *"Even a technology that improves things for some women may not qualify as feminist if it does so in a way that perpetuates a gender gap"*[5]

### Case Study Framework

◻ **case studies** → *examine* → ◻ **technologies marketed as liberating**
   *"In each case, the product or products we studied are ones not only designed for and used by women, but also touted as liberating for women"*[5]

◻ **menstrual-suppressing birth control pills** → *are evaluated through* → ◻ **feminist technology assessment**
   *"The Need to Bleed? A Feminist Technology Assessment of Menstrual-Suppressing Birth Control Pills"*[5]

◻ **home pregnancy test** → *is critiqued as* → ◻ **not the feminist technology it's marketed as**
   *"Why the Home Pregnancy Test Isn't the Feminist Technology It's Cracked Up to Be and How to Make It Better"*[5]

◻ **breast pumps** → *pose question of* → ◻ **feminist technology or more work for mother**
   *"Breast Pumps: A Feminist Technology, or (yet) 'More Work for Mother'?"*[5]

◻ **tampons** → *can be* → ◻ **re-scripted as feminist**
   *"Tampons: Re-Scripting Technologies as Feminist"*[5]

## Design and Intervention Framework

### Design Approaches

◻ **feminist design** → *can be* → ◻ **taught**
   *"Teaching Feminist Technology Design"*[5]

◻ **feminist inventor's studio** → *provides space for* → ◻ **feminist innovation**
   *"A Feminist Inventor's Studio"*[5]

◻ **feminist design** → *requires* → ◻ **active intervention**
   *"This volume explores ways of actively intervening to develop better tools for designing, promoting, and evaluating feminist technologies"*[1][5][6]

### Multidimensional Assessment

◻ **feminist technology assessment** → *considers* → ◻ **multiple consequences**
   *"The introduction of new technologies always entails multiple consequences, some of which may be contradictory, many of which will be unintended"*[5]

◻ **feminist technology evaluation** → *weighs* → ◻ **costs against benefits**
   *"In order to determine whether a technology is empowering...one would have to consider all the consequences of using (or not using) a technology. What benefits does this new technology bring? What costs? Then one would have to determine whether the costs outweigh the benefits, or vice versa"*[5]

◻ **feminist engagement** → *ranges from* → ◻ **subaltern alignment to constructive mediation**
   *"From Subaltern Alignment to Constructive Mediation: Modes of Feminist Engagement in the Design of Reproductive Technologies"*[5]

## Conclusion

This Spencer-Brown inspired ontological model captures the rich theoretical framework of "Feminist Technology." Through formal distinctions (◻) and indications (→), we visualize how the editors and contributors conceptualize and evaluate technologies designed for women. The model highlights the book's central inquiry into what makes a technology feminist, revealing that marketing claims, feminized aesthetics, and even intended empowerment are insufficient criteria. Instead, truly feminist technologies must be assessed through complex evaluations of their design processes, material qualities, marketing, use patterns, and especially their overall consequences for diverse groups of women. The structured index also reveals the book's practical commitment to active intervention in technology design and assessment to better serve women's varied needs and capacities.
