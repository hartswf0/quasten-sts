<h2>1. Problem Statement</h2>
<ol>
<li>Bogost, Ian - Persuasive Games (2007)</li>
</ol>
<p>Focused Problem Statement: Analyzing serious games like a climate change simulator (L1 Machine Layer) only through their narrative or visual elements obscures their primary persuasive mode, identified by Bogost (L3 Framing) as "procedural rhetoric." The game's rule-based simulation of climate dynamics (L0 Reality) implicitly argues for specific viewpoints (L4 Embedded Ideology) through the consequences experienced by the player (L2 Human Use), a rhetorical function masked if only surface features are considered.</p>
<h2>2. Core Model</h2>
<p><strong>9. Bogost, Ian - Persuasive Games (2007)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>MODEL:</strong> Argues that video games function as persuasive rhetoric not just through narrative or visuals, but primarily through their underlying rules and systems ("procedural rhetoric"), which model real-world processes and implicitly argue for particular perspectives or ideologies.</li>
