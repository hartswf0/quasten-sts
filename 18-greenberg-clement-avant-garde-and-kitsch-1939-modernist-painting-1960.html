<h2>1. Problem Statement</h2>
<ol>
<li>Greenberg, Clement - “Avant-garde and Kitsch” (1939) &amp; “Modernist Painting” (1960)</li>
</ol>
<p>Focused Problem Statement: Explaining the success of Abstract Expressionism (L1 Artifact) simply through artist biography or general post-war angst obscures the specific formalist logic championed by Greenberg (L3 Framing). His model posits the paintings' value lies in fulfilling a historical imperative towards medium specificity (L0 Material Reality/History), a purification interpreted by critics/collectors (L2) as resisting kitsch, reflecting latent assumptions about aesthetic purity and avant-garde roles (L4).</p>
<h2>2. Core Model</h2>
<p><strong>18. Greenberg, Clement - “Avant-garde and Kitsch” / “Modernist Painting” (1939 / 1960)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>MODEL:</strong> Argues that true avant-garde art maintains high culture standards against the debased, formulaic "kitsch" produced for mass consumption; and that Modernist painting progressively purifies itself by emphasizing properties unique to the medium itself, particularly flatness.</li>

<li><strong>→ [Delimits] → ◻ CONTEXT BOUNDARY:</strong> Privileges specific lineage of modern art (Manet to Abstract Expressionism), sharply separates avant-garde from kitsch, downplays social content unless reflected in form.</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>→ [Manifests As] → ◻ PHENOMENON:</strong> Avant-Garde vs. Kitsch &amp; Modernist Self-Criticism – The historical necessity for a conscious avant-garde to sustain high culture against the corrosive effects of industrialized mass culture (kitsch). Modernist art progresses through a process of self-criticism, progressively purifying itself by emphasizing qualities unique to its specific medium (e.g., flatness in painting).</li>

<li><strong>→ [Constructs] → ◻ REPRESENTATION:</strong> A hierarchical model of culture (avant-garde vs. kitsch) and a teleological history of modernist painting.</li>
<li><strong>→ [Optimizes] → ◻ RECURSION:</strong> Applying the formalist criteria historically to trace the "correct" lineage of modernist development.<ul>
<li><strong>→ [Embeds] → ◻ MODEL:</strong> Kantian aesthetics (disinterestedness, form), theories of historical progress, medium specificity.</li>
<li><strong>→ [Projects] → ◻ METRIC:</strong> Degree of formal purity, flatness, self-reflexivity, aesthetic quality (hierarchical judgment).</li>
<li><strong>→ [Seeks] → ◻ FIXED POINT:</strong> The ultimate realization of a medium's essential properties (e.g., pure abstraction/flatness for painting).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>◻ METAMODEL:</strong> Formalist Theory of Modern Art History. Governs aesthetic judgment and historical interpretation. Binds Artistic Medium Properties DOMAIN ↔ Aesthetic Value/Historical Significance CODMAIN.</li>

<li><code>◻ MODEL (Formalist theory/historical narrative) | ◻ REALITY (Diverse art practices/social contexts)</code> → <code>◻ MEASUREMENT ARTIFACT</code> (The model elevates certain artworks fitting its criteria and dismisses others, creating a selective historical artifact).</li>
<li><code>◻ TIME-LIKE (Historical progression of modernism)</code> is central. <code>SPACE-LIKE</code> (The essential properties of the medium, e.g., the flat surface). Modernism is seen as time uncovering the essential space of the medium.</li>
<li><code>◻ CONTINUOUS (History of art) | ◻ DISCRETE (Avant-garde vs. Kitsch categories, stages of modernist development)</code> → <code>◻ SAMPLING THRESHOLD</code> (Imposes sharp discrete categories onto the more continuous field of cultural production).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Operations:</strong> <code>Observe</code> artworks through a formalist lens. <code>Encode</code> them based on medium specificity and relation to kitsch. <code>Convolve</code> artworks (<code>PATCH</code>) with historical context (<code>KERNEL</code>) to place them in the modernist teleology. <code>Entangle</code> formal purity (<code>FEATURE</code>) with aesthetic value (<code>FEATURE</code>). Intentionally <code>Forget</code>s aspects deemed non-essential to the medium.</li>
