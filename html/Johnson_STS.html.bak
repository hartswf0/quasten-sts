            <h1>A Spencer-Brown Inspired Ontological Model of Johnson's "Computer Ethics"</h1>

This report presents a structured ontological index of Deborah G. Johnson's influential 2009 work "Computer Ethics" (4th edition) using Spencer-Brown's calculus of distinctions. By marking entities as distinctions (◻) and relationships as indications (→), we create a formal representation that illuminates the conceptual architecture of this foundational text in computer ethics.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

This Spencer-Brown inspired ontological model captures the rich theoretical framework of Johnson's "Computer Ethics." Through formal distinctions (◻) and indications (→), we visualize how Johnson conceptualizes computer ethics as a sociotechnical enterprise that recognizes the mutual shaping of technology and society. The model highlights the book's central innovation: moving beyond the standard account to a more nuanced understanding of technology as value-laden and embedded in social contexts. This structured index reveals how Johnson's work integrates ethical theory, sociological analysis, and professional practice to address the distinctive challenges posed by information technology.
