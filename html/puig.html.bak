            <h1>A Spencer-Brown Inspired Ontological Model of María Puig de la Bellacasa's "Matters of Care"</h1>

This report presents a structured ontological framework for María Puig de la Bellacasa's influential work "Matters of Care: Speculative Ethics in More Than Human Worlds" using Spencer-Brown's calculus of distinctions. By marking entities as distinctions (◻) and relationships as indications (→), we create a formal representation of the book's conceptual architecture that illuminates its key contributions to care ethics, posthumanism, and science and technology studies.

<h2>Foundational Entities and Primary Distinctions</h2>

<h3>Core Conceptual Distinctions</h3>

◻ <strong>matters of care</strong>: The central theoretical contribution that extends beyond matters of concern

◻ <strong>care</strong>: A multidimensional concept described as "everything that we do to maintain, continue and repair 'our world' so that we can live in it as well as possible"[1][2]

◻ <strong>speculative ethics</strong>: An approach that engages with possible futures and alternative modes of relating

◻ <strong>more-than-human worlds</strong>: The expanded ontological terrain where human and non-human agencies intertwine

◻ <strong>matters of concern</strong>: Bruno Latour's concept describing actively contested and constructed knowledge[1]

◻ <strong>matters of fact</strong>: Ostensibly settled knowledge that Latour distinguishes from matters of concern[1]

<h3>Dimensional Distinctions of Care</h3>

◻ <strong>labor/work dimension</strong>: The material practices involved in actualizing care[2]

◻ <strong>affect/affections dimension</strong>: The emotional and relational aspects of care[2]

◻ <strong>ethics/politics dimension</strong>: The normative commitments and power relations in care practices[2]

◻ <strong>maintenance practices</strong>: The concrete activities involved in sustaining worlds[1][2]

◻ <strong>interdependency</strong>: The ontological condition of mutual reliance between entities[2]

<h2>Morphisms and Relational Structures</h2>

<h3>Transformative Relations</h3>

◻ <strong>matters of concern</strong> → <em>transforms into</em> → ◻ <strong>matters of care</strong>
   <em>Extending Latour's concept by adding an ethic of care</em>[1][3]

◻ <strong>care</strong> → <em>encompasses</em> → ◻ <strong>labor/work</strong>
   <em>Care includes material practices of maintenance</em>[2]

◻ <strong>care</strong> → <em>encompasses</em> → ◻ <strong>affect/affections</strong>
   <em>Care involves emotional and relational engagement</em>[2]

◻ <strong>care</strong> → <em>encompasses</em> → ◻ <strong>ethics/politics</strong>
   <em>Care entails normative commitments and power relations</em>[2]

◻ <strong>human agency</strong> → <em>expands to</em> → ◻ <strong>more-than-human agency</strong>
   <em>Care ethics extends beyond human-centered frameworks</em>[1][11]

<h3>Knowledge Production Relations</h3>

◻ <strong>thinking-with</strong> → <em>is a mode of</em> → ◻ <strong>caring scholarship</strong>
   <em>Scholars engage in uneasy but committed dialogues with conflicting ideas</em>[1]

◻ <strong>dissenting-within</strong> → <em>is a mode of</em> → ◻ <strong>caring scholarship</strong>
   <em>Critical engagement through appropriation, redirection, and reworking</em>[1]

◻ <strong>speaking-for</strong> → <em>is a mode of</em> → ◻ <strong>caring scholarship</strong>
   <em>Acknowledging the displacement of voice when adopting marginalized perspectives</em>[1]

◻ <strong>touching vision</strong> → <em>reorients</em> → ◻ <strong>ways of knowing</strong>
   <em>Vision becomes sensitive to its vulnerable, subjective and relational grounding</em>[1]

<h2>Complex Conceptual Structures</h2>

<h3>The Touch Complex</h3>

◻ <strong>touch</strong> → <em>enables</em> → ◻ <strong>mutual knowing</strong>
   <em>What is learned through touch depends on the response of the other being touched</em>[1]

◻ <strong>touch</strong> → <em>confounds</em> → ◻ <strong>subject-object distinctions</strong>
   <em>Touch flows in both directions—what we touch touches us as well</em>[1]

◻ <strong>touch</strong> → <em>transforms</em> → ◻ <strong>vision</strong>
   <em>Creates a form of seeing sensitive to its own vulnerability and relationality</em>[1]

<h3>The Alterbiopolitics Framework</h3>

◻ <strong>alterbiopolitics</strong> → <em>displaces</em> → ◻ <strong>individual ethics</strong>
   <em>When self-sustenance and collective outcomes are entangled, individual/collective distinctions break down</em>[1]

◻ <strong>permaculture</strong> → <em>informs</em> → ◻ <strong>alterbiopolitics</strong>
   <em>Practical experiences of interdependency inform collective modes of ethics</em>[1][13]

◻ <strong>alterbiopolitics</strong> → <em>emerges from</em> → ◻ <strong>everyday relationships</strong>
   <em>Ethics emerges speculatively out of the mutuality of everyday relationships</em>[1]

<h3>Care Temporality Complex</h3>

◻ <strong>soil care</strong> → <em>exemplifies</em> → ◻ <strong>care temporalities</strong>
   <em>Care for soil involves slow, unfolding temporalities</em>[1]

◻ <strong>care temporalities</strong> → <em>contrast with</em> → ◻ <strong>technological futures</strong>
   <em>Care temporalities differ from rapid, innovation-driven imaginaries</em>[1]

◻ <strong>speculative commitment</strong> → <em>prevents reduction of</em> → ◻ <strong>natural entities to resources</strong>
   <em>Attention to unfolding temporalities resists objectification</em>[1]

<h2>Ethical and Epistemological Extensions</h2>

<h3>Care Beyond Anthropocentrism</h3>

◻ <strong>care</strong> → <em>extends to</em> → ◻ <strong>non-human others</strong>
   <em>Care attunes us to the care-like work done by non-human others</em>[1]

◻ <strong>anthropomorphism</strong> → <em>becomes productive as</em> → ◻ <strong>speculative move</strong>
   <em>Imagining non-human others as caring pays attention to their particularity</em>[1]

◻ <strong>care ethics</strong> → <em>bridges</em> → ◻ <strong>posthumanism</strong>
   <em>Care ethics connects with posthumanist perspectives while maintaining feminist commitments</em>[5][13]

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

This Spencer-Brown inspired ontological model captures the rich conceptual architecture of Puig de la Bellacasa's "Matters of Care." Through formal distinctions (◻) and indications (→), we can visualize how the book extends care ethics beyond human-centered frameworks while maintaining its feminist grounding. The model highlights the book's central contribution: transforming matters of concern into matters of care through speculative ethics that attend to interdependency in more-than-human worlds.

This structured representation demonstrates how Puig de la Bellacasa's work bridges care ethics, science and technology studies, and posthumanism to develop a framework for ethical engagement that is simultaneously material, affective, and political—opening new possibilities for thinking about and practicing care in complex technoscientific worlds.
