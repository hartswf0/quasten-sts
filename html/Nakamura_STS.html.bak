            <h1>A Spencer-Brown Inspired Ontological Model of Nakamura's "Indigenous Circuits"</h1>

This report presents a structured ontological index of Lisa Nakamura's influential 2014 article "Indigenous Circuits: Navajo Women and the Racialization of Early Electronic Manufacture" using Spencer-Brown's calculus of distinctions. By marking entities as distinctions (◻) and relationships as indications (→), we create a formal representation that illuminates the conceptual architecture of racialized labor in early electronic manufacturing.

<h2>Foundational Entities and Primary Distinctions</h2>

<h3>Core Theoretical Constructs</h3>

◻ <strong>Indigenous Circuits</strong>: Nakamura's 2014 article examining Navajo women's labor in electronics manufacturing

◻ <strong>racialization</strong>: Process attributing racial characteristics to industrial capabilities and practices

◻ <strong>cyborg feminism</strong>: Theoretical framework connecting to Donna Haraway's work on women in the integrated circuit

◻ <strong>feminist technology studies</strong>: Field examining gendered dimensions of technological production

◻ <strong>affective labor</strong>: Work understood as emotional investment rather than purely wage-based

◻ <strong>visual rhetoric</strong>: Symbolic representation legitimizing particular labor arrangements

<h3>Historical Entities</h3>

◻ <strong>Fairchild Semiconductor</strong>: Silicon Valley company operating on Navajo land from 1965-1975

◻ <strong>Shiprock plant</strong>: Manufacturing facility located on Navajo reservation in New Mexico

◻ <strong>Navajo women workers</strong>: Primary labor force assembling integrated circuits

◻ <strong>American Indian Movement</strong>: Activist group that eventually occupied the plant in 1975

◻ <strong>Russell Means</strong>: Activist leader involved in plant closure

<h2>Morphisms and Relational Structures</h2>

<h3>Core Industrial Relationships</h3>

◻ <strong>Fairchild Semiconductor</strong> → <em>operated</em> → ◻ <strong>Shiprock plant</strong>
   <em>"From 1965 to 1975 the legendary Silicon Valley company Fairchild Semiconductor operated a state-of-the-art integrated circuit manufacturing plant in Shiprock, New Mexico on Navajo land"[3]</em>

◻ <strong>Navajo women</strong> → <em>assembled</em> → ◻ <strong>integrated circuits</strong>
   <em>"The women workers, pictured hovering over microscopes, were doing assembling integrated circuits"[3]</em>

◻ <strong>Fairchild</strong> → <em>employed</em> → ◻ <strong>Navajo women</strong>
   <em>"At its height, the plant provided work for more than 1,000 Navajos... Fairchild became the largest industrial employer in New Mexico and the largest employer of Indians in the country"[3]</em>

◻ <strong>Shiprock plant</strong> → <em>closed in</em> → ◻ <strong>1975</strong>
   <em>"The production of advanced electronic components by Navajo women was to be a time-limited project, running from 1965 to 1975"[3]</em>

<h3>Racialization Framework</h3>

◻ <strong>Fairchild</strong> → <em>claimed</em> → ◻ <strong>"inherent flexibility and dexterity" of Navajo workers</strong>
   <em>"Both Fairchild's corporate newsletter and Businessweek credited plant manager Paul Driscoll with discovering and exploiting the 'untapped wealth of natural characteristics of the Navajo...the inherent flexibility and dexterity of the Indians'"[3]</em>

◻ <strong>Navajo women</strong> → <em>were represented as</em> → ◻ <strong>"ideal predigital digital workers"</strong>
   <em>"Navajo women workers were described as ideal predigital digital workers, uniquely suited to the job by temperament, culture, and gender"[8]</em>

◻ <strong>rug weaving</strong> → <em>was equated with</em> → ◻ <strong>circuit design skills</strong>
   <em>"'For example, after years of rug weaving, Indians were able to visualize complicated patterns and could, therefore, memorize complex integrated circuit designs and make subjective decisions in sorting and quality control'"[3]</em>

◻ <strong>racial stereotypes</strong> → <em>transformed from negative to positive</em> → ◻ <strong>for economic exploitation</strong>
   <em>"beliefs about Indians as unreliable workers unsuited for modern form of labor [were] transformed into assertions of the positive value of 'primitive' habits"[11]</em>

<h2>Complex Conceptual Structures</h2>

<h3>Visual Rhetoric Framework</h3>

◻ <strong>Fairchild brochure</strong> → <em>visually connected</em> → ◻ <strong>Navajo rugs and integrated circuits</strong>
   <em>"The resemblance between the pattern of the rug depicted on the first page and the circuit is striking and uncanny"[3]</em>

◻ <strong>brochure imagery</strong> → <em>created argument that</em> → ◻ <strong>Indian rugs and circuits shared aesthetic tradition</strong>
   <em>"It makes the visual argument that Indian rugs are merely a different material iteration of the same pattern or aesthetic tradition found within the integrated circuit"[3]</em>

◻ <strong>marketing materials</strong> → <em>portrayed circuit work as</em> → ◻ <strong>extension of traditional culture</strong>
   <em>"Nakamura finds that Fairchild's manipulation of these ideologies was reflected directly in their advertisements in which circuitry was presented as 'an extension of an existing, indigenous practice'"[11]</em>

<h3>Economic-Cultural Framework</h3>

◻ <strong>Navajo reservation</strong> → <em>provided</em> → ◻ <strong>space of exception to US labor laws</strong>
   <em>"This meant that the 'reservation provided spaces of exception to US laws on minimum wage' since it was a separate nation and Fairchild also received 'liberal government loan and tax relief' benefits"[11]</em>

◻ <strong>insourcing</strong> → <em>offered benefits similar to</em> → ◻ <strong>outsourcing</strong>
   <em>"The Shiprock plant was represented by Fairchild as 'a new and innovative model for cheap domestic electronics manufacture: insourcing rather than outsourcing'"[11]</em>

◻ <strong>Fairchild</strong> → <em>exploited</em> → ◻ <strong>high unemployment rate of Navajo women</strong>
   <em>"There was also the benefit of there being 'an extremely high unemployment rate' for Native women on the reservation coupled with 'an almost complete lack of other wage-based employment options'"[11]</em>

<h3>Theoretical Integration Framework</h3>

◻ <strong>Shiprock case</strong> → <em>demonstrates</em> → ◻ <strong>technology production's racialized history</strong>
   <em>"Navajo women did not make circuits because their brains naturally 'thought' in patterns of right-angle colors and shapes. They did not make them well because they had inherent Indian virtues"[3]</em>

◻ <strong>Donna Haraway's work</strong> → <em>anticipated</em> → ◻ <strong>Nakamura's analysis</strong>
   <em>"Haraway's critical perspective on digital technology's possibilities and opportunities for intersectional feminism expresses itself in this essay by standing readerly expectation on its head"[12]</em>

◻ <strong>Navajo women's labor</strong> → <em>was positioned as</em> → ◻ <strong>"labor of love"</strong>
   <em>"A 1969 Fairchild brochure celebrates Indian women circuit makers as culture workers who produced circuits as part of the 'reproductive' labor of expressing Navajo culture, rather than merely for wages"[3]</em>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

This Spencer-Brown inspired ontological model captures the rich theoretical framework of Nakamura's "Indigenous Circuits." Through formal distinctions (◻) and indications (→), we visualize how Fairchild Semiconductor exploited racial stereotypes to position Navajo women as "naturally" suited for the tedious labor of circuit assembly. The model highlights how the company's visual rhetoric equated traditional crafts like weaving with electronics manufacturing, transforming cultural practices into supposed innate aptitudes. This structured index reveals how Nakamura's analysis contributes to feminist technology studies by exposing the racial and gendered dimensions of early computing history, illuminating what Haraway called the "integrated circuit" that connects human laborers to technological production.
