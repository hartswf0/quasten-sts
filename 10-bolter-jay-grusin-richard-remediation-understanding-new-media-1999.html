<h2>1. Problem Statement</h2>
<ol>
<li>Bolter, Jay &amp; Grusin, Richard - Remediation: Understanding New Media. (1999)</li>
</ol>
<p>Focused Problem Statement: Describing early news websites (L1 Machine Layer) simply as "digital newspapers" obscures the complex process of remediation identified by Bolter &amp; Grusin (L3 Framing). The website actively simulates and filters print conventions (L0 Reality), driven by contradictory cultural desires for both transparent immediacy and fascination with the new medium's interface (L4 Logics), shaping user experience (L2) in ways missed by simple equivalence.</p>
<h2>2. Core Model</h2>
<p><strong>10. Bolter, Jay &amp; Grusin, Richard - Remediation: Understanding New Media. (1999)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>MODEL:</strong> Proposes that new media forms achieve cultural significance by "remediating" older media forms – that is, by borrowing, repurposing, critiquing, and refashioning their conventions – operating under a dual logic of immediacy (trying to erase the medium) and hypermediacy (drawing attention to the medium).</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>→ [Manifests As] → ◻ PHENOMENON:</strong> Remediation – The process by which new media refashion, incorporate, critique, and absorb prior media forms, driven by the dual (and often contradictory) cultural logics of immediacy (desire for transparent reality) and hypermediacy (fascination with the medium itself).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>◻ ENGINE:</strong> Formal Media Analysis / Logic Identification.<ul>
<li><strong>→ [Applies] → ◻ TRANSFORM:</strong> Identifying instances and strategies of remediation, classifying them according to the logics of immediacy and hypermediacy.<ul>
<li><strong>→ [Operates On] → ◻ PATCH:</strong> Specific media artifacts or interfaces.</li>
<li><strong>→ [Produces] → ◻ INVARIANT:</strong> The underlying logics of immediacy and hypermediacy; the pattern of remediation as a driving force in media history.</li>
<li><strong>→ [Requires] → ◻ CONTRACTION:</strong> Focusing on the formal relationship between media, bracketing specific content or social context in the initial analysis.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>→ [Constructs] → ◻ REPRESENTATION:</strong> A theory of media evolution based on the concept of remediation and its dual logics.</li>
<li><strong>→ [Optimizes] → ◻ RECURSION:</strong> Applying the remediation framework across different media and historical periods.<ul>

<li><strong>Distinctions &amp; Crossings:</strong><ul>
<li><code>◻ MODEL (The remediating medium) | ◻ REALITY (The remediated medium OR the reality it tries to represent)</code> → <code>◻ MEASUREMENT ARTIFACT</code> (The way the new medium frames the old, or frames reality, is an artifact of its specific remediation strategy).</li>
<li><code>◻ TIME-LIKE (Historical sequence of media) | ◻ SPACE-LIKE (The co-existence and interaction of media forms in culture)</code>. The <code>CAUSAL CONE</code> shows influence flowing from older to newer media (and sometimes back).</li>
<li><code>◻ CONTINUOUS (The ongoing cultural desire for immediacy/hypermediacy) | ◻ DISCRETE (Specific media artifacts embodying these logics)</code> → <code>◻ SAMPLING THRESHOLD</code> (Analyzing discrete artifacts to understand the continuous underlying cultural drives).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Operations:</strong> <code>Observe</code> media forms and interfaces. <code>Encode</code> them based on immediacy/hypermediacy markers and references to other media. <code>Entangle</code> the features of one medium (<code>FEATURE</code>) with the form of another. Helps <code>Forget</code> the idea of media existing in isolation.</li>
