# A Spencer-Brown Inspired Ontological Model of Jameson's "Postmodernism, or, The Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism"

This report presents a structured ontological index of Fredric Jameson's influential 1991 work "Postmodernism, or, The Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism" using Spencer-Brown's calculus of distinctions. By marking entities as distinctions (◻) and relationships as indications (→), we create a formal representation that illuminates the conceptual architecture of Jameson's analysis of postmodernism as the cultural dominant of late capitalism.

## Foundational Entities and Primary Distinctions

### Core Theoretical Constructs

◻ **Postmodernism**: Cultural logic corresponding to late capitalism

◻ **late capitalism**: Third stage of capitalism (also called multinational or consumer capitalism)

◻ **cultural logic**: System of representation corresponding to economic organization

◻ **cognitive mapping**: Proposed aesthetic practice to orient subjects within global capitalism

◻ **waning of affect**: Emotional flatness and depthlessness characteristic of postmodern experience

◻ **depthlessness**: Superficiality replacing depth models in culture and experience

◻ **pastiche**: Blank parody without satirical impulse that cannibalizes past styles

◻ **crisis of historicity**: Inability to connect meaningfully with history or conceive coherent future

### Historical Stages of Capitalism

◻ **market capitalism**: Initial stage of capitalist development (18th-19th centuries)

◻ **monopoly capitalism**: Second stage featuring industrial production and imperialism (late 19th-early 20th centuries)

◻ **multinational capitalism**: Contemporary stage featuring global networks and information technologies

◻ **realism**: Cultural logic corresponding to market capitalism

◻ **modernism**: Cultural logic corresponding to monopoly capitalism

## Morphisms and Relational Structures

### Foundational Relationships

◻ **postmodernism** → *is* → ◻ **cultural logic of late capitalism**
   *"For Jameson, postmodernism is the cultural logic or system of expression associated with the currently dominant form of capitalism, which he terms 'late capitalism'"*

◻ **late capitalism** → *produces* → ◻ **postmodernism**
   *"Jameson defined postmodernism as the cultural system of a global, financialized stage of capitalist society"*

◻ **cognitive mapping** → *responds to* → ◻ **postmodern disorientation**
   *"Jameson introduces the concept of 'cognitive mapping' as a solution to the disorientation of postmodern culture"*

◻ **capitalist stages** → *correspond to* → ◻ **cultural logics**
   *"Jameson claims that our cultural Logics are intrinsically tied to our political and economic system"*

### Characteristic Features Framework

◻ **pastiche** → *replaces* → ◻ **parody**
   *"Jameson argues that parody (which implies a moral judgment or a comparison with societal norms) was replaced by pastiche"*

◻ **depthlessness** → *characterizes* → ◻ **postmodern culture**
   *"The first feature that Jameson identifies of postmodern culture is a kind of deathlessness a flatness a new kind of superficiality"*

◻ **postmodernism** → *produces* → ◻ **fragmentation**
   *"Postmodernism is characterized by a 'crisis of historicity', a 'waning of affect', and a prevalence of pastiche"*

◻ **late capitalism** → *weakens* → ◻ **historical consciousness**
   *"Jameson argues that the postmodern era suffers from a crisis in historicity"*

## Complex Conceptual Structures

### Art and Architecture Framework

◻ **Van Gogh's "Peasant Shoes"** → *exemplifies* → ◻ **modernist depth**
   *"He demonstrates this point by comparing two paintings of shoes one by the modernist artist Vincent van Gogh and the other by the postmodernist artist Andy Warhol"*

◻ **Warhol's "Diamond Dust Shoes"** → *exemplifies* → ◻ **postmodern flatness**
   *"Van Go's shoes were probably worn by its owner for many years they conjure up visions of agricultural toil and Rural poverty... Warhol's shoes on the other hand are completely flat and depthless"*

◻ **Bonaventure Hotel** → *embodies* → ◻ **postmodern hyperspace**
   *"Our inability to comprehend or to understand the Bon Aventure hotel is symbolic of our inability to comprehend or navigate the world of late capitalism"*

◻ **postmodern architecture** → *produces* → ◻ **disorientation**
   *"This building represents the predicament that we as individuals find ourselves in we live in Late capitalism completely overwhelmed by information networks"*

### Phenomenological Framework

◻ **postmodern sublime** → *arises from* → ◻ **incomprehensible networks**
   *"Jameson calls this feeling of being unable to process the sheer quantity of information available within Lake capitalism the postmodern Sublime"*

◻ **postmodernism** → *blurs* → ◻ **distinction between high and mass culture**
   *"For Jameson, postmodernism, as a form of mass-culture driven by capitalism, pervades every aspect of our daily lives"*

◻ **nostalgia** → *replaces* → ◻ **genuine historical consciousness**
   *"Culture is now organized around 'nostalgia' rather than genuine historical consciousness"*

◻ **historicity** → *is now* → ◻ **stylistic connotation conveyed by aesthetic artifacts**
   *"There no longer does seem to be any organic relationship between the American history we learn from schoolbooks and the lived experience of the current, multinational, high-rise, stagflated city"*

## Political and Theoretical Framework

### Marxist Analysis Framework

◻ **Jameson** → *views* → ◻ **postmodernism as object of analysis rather than moral judgment**
   *"Jameson's analysis of postmodernism attempts to view it as historically grounded; he therefore explicitly rejects any moralistic opposition to postmodernity as a cultural phenomenon"*

◻ **cognitive mapping** → *aims to* → ◻ **represent totality of global system**
   *"Cognitive mapping functions as a tool for postmodern subjects to represent the totality of the global late capitalist system"*

◻ **political art** → *must develop* → ◻ **new aesthetic of cognitive mapping**
   *"In 'Postmodernism, or, The Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism,' Frederic Jameson mentions an 'aesthetic of cognitive mapping' as a new form of radical aesthetic practice"*

◻ **postmodernism** → *contains* → ◻ **both catastrophe and progress dialectically**
   *"[Jameson] continued to insist upon a Hegelian immanent critique that would 'think the cultural evolution of late capitalism dialectically, as catastrophe and progress all together'"*

## Conclusion

This Spencer-Brown inspired ontological model captures the rich theoretical framework of Jameson's "Postmodernism, or, The Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism." Through formal distinctions (◻) and indications (→), we visualize how Jameson conceptualizes postmodernism not as a style or aesthetic choice but as the cultural expression of late capitalism. The model highlights his analysis of postmodernism's key features—depthlessness, pastiche, fragmentation, and the waning of affect—while also representing his proposed response of cognitive mapping. By organizing these relationships, we gain insight into Jameson's influential Marxist analysis of contemporary culture and its relationship to global economic systems.
