# A Spencer-Brown Inspired Ontological Model of "Toward Information Infrastructure Studies"

This report presents a structured ontological index of Geoffrey C. Bowker, Karen Baker, Florence Millerand, and David Ribes' influential work "Toward Information Infrastructure Studies: Ways of Knowing in a Networked Environment" using Spencer-Brown's calculus of distinctions. By marking entities as distinctions (◻) and relationships as indications (→), we create a formal representation that illuminates the conceptual architecture of information infrastructures and their study.

## Foundational Entities and Primary Distinctions

### Core Theoretical Constructs

◻ **information infrastructure (II)**: Complex, relational environments that support the flow of data and distributed activities

◻ **information infrastructure studies**: Proposed research area examining infrastructure design, use, and sustainability

◻ **ways of knowing**: Various epistemologies enabled by networked environments

◻ **networked environment**: Sociotechnical context for information exchange and collaboration

◻ **infrastructuring**: Ongoing process of creating, implementing, and using infrastructures

◻ **ecological approach**: Perspective emphasizing relationships between components rather than components themselves

### Key Characteristics of Information Infrastructures

◻ **openness**: Lack of fixed notion of users in information infrastructures

◻ **interconnection**: Linkages between numerous modules and systems

◻ **multiplicity**: Diverse purposes, agendas, and strategies within infrastructures

◻ **installed base**: Existing systems and practices that shape and constrain design

◻ **temporal extension**: Endurance over long periods (decades rather than years)

◻ **spatial distribution**: Stretching across many different locales

## Morphisms and Relational Structures

### Definitional Relations

◻ **information infrastructure** → *is characterized by* → ◻ **openness**
   *No fixed notion of users defines information infrastructures*[3]

◻ **information infrastructure** → *exhibits* → ◻ **interconnections**
   *Numerous modules/systems are linked in infrastructure*[3]

◻ **information infrastructure** → *contains* → ◻ **multiplicity of purposes**
   *Various agendas and strategies coexist within infrastructures*[3]

◻ **information infrastructure** → *is shaped by* → ◻ **installed base**
   *Existing systems and practices restrict design scope*[3]

◻ **information infrastructure** → *stretches across* → ◻ **space and time**
   *Used across different locales and enduring over long periods*[3]

### Methodological Relationships

◻ **information infrastructure studies** → *provides* → ◻ **theoretical context**
   *Understanding needed for dialogue between design, use, and sustainability*[1]

◻ **ecological approach** → *focuses on* → ◻ **infrastructural relations**
   *Shift from components to relationships between components*[3]

◻ **infrastructural inversion** → *helps escape* → ◻ **master narratives**
   *Methodological approach revealing relational aspects hidden by institutionalized discourse*[3]

◻ **infrastructural inversion** → *enables focus on* → ◻ **whole enterprise**
   *Ecological viewpoint examining complete relational systems*[3]

### Process Relationships

◻ **infrastructuring** → *is* → ◻ **ongoing process**
   *Continuous activity rather than discrete event*[3]

◻ **infrastructuring** → *involves* → ◻ **design, implementation, use**
   *Multiple activities comprising infrastructure development*[3]

◻ **infrastructuring** → *resolves tensions between* → ◻ **local and global**
   *Managing contradictions across spatial scales*[3]

◻ **infrastructuring** → *resolves tensions between* → ◻ **present requirements and future users**
   *Managing contradictions across temporal scales*[3]

◻ **infrastructuring** → *resolves tensions between* → ◻ **planned and emergent action**
   *Managing contradictions between design and actual use*[3]

## Complex Conceptual Structures

### Scaling Dimensions

◻ **scaling dimensions** → *include* → ◻ **enactment, organizing, institutionalization**
   *Three spheres of infrastructural scaling activities*[3]

◻ **enactment** → *involves* → ◻ **deploying durable resources**
   *Technological venture supporting work and collaboration*[3]

◻ **organizing** → *enables* → ◻ **long-term projects**
   *Organizational arrangements sustaining infrastructure over time*[3]

◻ **institutionalization** → *links to* → ◻ **wider long-term goals**
   *Activities connecting infrastructure to broader objectives*[3]

### Ontological Dimensions

◻ **ontologizing practices** → *consist of* → ◻ **building ontology and ontology work**
   *Two aspects of creating infrastructure ontologies*[3]

◻ **building ontology** → *involves* → ◻ **formalizing domain knowledge**
   *Gathering and encoding knowledge into machine-computable format*[3]

◻ **ontology work** → *enables* → ◻ **knowledge distribution**
   *Taking knowledge from closed communities and allowing reuse by others*[3]

### Friction Points

◻ **data friction** → *occurs at* → ◻ **interfaces**
   *Resistance points where data can be garbled or lost*[3]

◻ **interfaces** → *exist between* → ◻ **groups, organizations, machines**
   *Connection points within infrastructural systems*[3]

◻ **convergence** → *is* → ◻ **imperfect**
   *People and machines do not seamlessly integrate with each other*[3]

## Conclusion

This Spencer-Brown inspired ontological model captures the rich theoretical framework of Bowker et al.'s "Toward Information Infrastructure Studies." Through formal distinctions (◻) and indications (→), we visualize how they conceptualize information infrastructure as relational, temporally and spatially extended, and shaped through ongoing processes of infrastructuring. The model highlights their key methodological approach of infrastructural inversion, which reveals the often-invisible relations that constitute infrastructures, and their emphasis on scaling dimensions and ontologizing practices as crucial aspects of infrastructure studies.
