# A Spencer-Brown Inspired Ontological Model of Turkle's "The Second Self"

This report presents a structured ontological index of Sherry Turkle's influential 2005 twentieth anniversary edition of "The Second Self: Computers and the Human Spirit" using Spencer-Brown's calculus of distinctions. By marking entities as distinctions (◻) and relationships as indications (→), we create a formal representation that illuminates the conceptual architecture of human-computer interaction as explored by Turkle.

## Foundational Entities and Primary Distinctions

### Core Theoretical Constructs

◻ **The Second Self**: Turkle's book examining computers as part of our social and psychological lives

◻ **computer as evocative object**: Technology that provokes reflection on human nature

◻ **human-computer relationship**: Psychological connection between humans and machines

◻ **psychology of computation**: Study of how computers affect human thought and emotion

◻ **self-awareness**: Consciousness of oneself as influenced by technology

◻ **technological intimacy**: Emotional connection formed with digital devices

◻ **computational metaphor**: Using computer concepts to understand human cognition

### Developmental Framework

◻ **child development**: Process through which children mature psychologically

◻ **programming styles**: Approaches to computer interaction revealing psychological traits

◻ **hard mastery**: Imposing will over machines through precise planning

◻ **soft mastery**: Artistic approach that involves gradual exploration and response

◻ **adolescent identity formation**: How teens develop sense of self through technology

◻ **video game players**: Individuals in relationship with games and gaming communities

## Morphisms and Relational Structures

### Foundational Relationships

◻ **computer** → *sits on border between* → ◻ **animate and inanimate**
   *"Her interviews reveal that we experience computers as being on the border between inanimate and animate, as both an extension of the self and part of the external world"*[1][5]

◻ **computer** → *functions as* → ◻ **extension of self**
   *"Her interviews reveal that we experience computers as being on the border between inanimate and animate, as both an extension of the self and part of the external world"*[1][5]

◻ **technology** → *catalyzes changes in* → ◻ **how we think**
   *"'Technology,' she writes, 'catalyzes changes not only in what we do but in how we think'"*[1][5][8]

◻ **computer** → *enters into* → ◻ **cognitive and emotional development**
   *"In addition, Turkle argues, the interactive capability of the computer allows it to enter into the cognitive and emotional development of the child"*[6]

### Identity and Psychological Structures

◻ **child programmers** → *develop* → ◻ **distinctive programming styles**
   *"The young programmers develop distinctive programming styles as they attempt to achieve mastery of the computer"*[6]

◻ **very young children** → *grapple with* → ◻ **what it means to be alive**
   *"The very young children grapple with what it means to be alive and whether or not 'Merlin' is alive and why"*[6]

◻ **adolescents** → *search for* → ◻ **identity through machines**
   *"In Turkle's analysis, teens and preteens find in the computer a new language for self-reference, a govemable analogy to diverse problems of adolescent life"*[2]

◻ **PDA user** → *experiences crash as* → ◻ **"like a death"**
   *"(In the introduction to this edition, Turkle quotes a PDA user as saying, 'When my Palm crashed, it was like a death. I thought I had lost my mind')"*[1][5]

## Complex Conceptual Structures

### Human-Machine Interface Framework

◻ **computer** → *offers* → ◻ **new window for developmental processes**
   *"Turkle argues that computers provide a new window for developmental processes"*[6]

◻ **computational ideas** → *move from* → ◻ **computer subcultures to everyday life**
   *"In The Second Self she writes about how computational ideas are moving out from computer subcultures to touch the lives of those in the culture at large"*[6]

◻ **human-machine circuit** → *forms* → ◻ **hermetically closed system**
   *"The human and machine in a hermetically closed circuit of action such that the locus of control – and thus, of agency – becomes indiscernible"*[4]

◻ **users** → *read themselves in* → ◻ **computational metaphors**
   *"I bought my first PC the year she finished her book -- 1983. And I read myself in her words"*[4]

### Philosophical-Psychological Framework

◻ **computer interactions** → *reveal* → ◻ **human nature**
   *"The book traces the movement of computational ideas from computer subcultures to everyday life and points out their implications for growth and development"*[6][13]

◻ **Freudian slip metaphor** → *competes with* → ◻ **computational metaphor**
   *"In the Freudian explanation, some repressed drive or feeling causes us to do what we do not intend consciously. In the computational view, the action is the result of information overload and the interaction of a variety of complicated subprograms in our heads"*[6]

◻ **hackers** → *find* → ◻ **soul in the machine**
   *"The Romantics wanted to escape rationalist egoism by becoming one with nature. The hackers find soul in the machine"*[4]

◻ **human-computer relationship** → *is characterized by* → ◻ **cool intimacy**
   *"We join with our computers in a cool intimacy"*[4]

## Applied Framework and Empirical Examples

### Subcultures and Communities

◻ **hackers** → *feel* → ◻ **despised by world but strong in circuits**
   *"Finally, she talks with computer hackers -- the new 20th-century isolates. They feel despised by the world, but within the circuits they are strong and effective"*[4]

◻ **video game players** → *demonstrate* → ◻ **total mental engagement**
   *"Next Turkle watches teen-agers play Pac-Man. Most people think that's vapid escapism. She doesn't agree. Pac-man is rich in strategy. She sees total mental engagement with a machine"*[4]

◻ **computer subcultures** → *become* → ◻ **subject of ethnographic study**
   *"Later, Turkle, the sociologist, uses the same concept to explore three computer subcultures"*[6]

### Digital Development Dimensions

◻ **children's concerns** → *shift from* → ◻ **metaphysical to mastery**
   *"As children's concerns shift from the metaphysical to mastery of their worlds and to exploring their identities, these changes are reflected in the ways they approach computers"*[6]

◻ **electronic worlds** → *can function as* → ◻ **retreats from social interaction**
   *"She also details cases of children using their electronic worlds as retreats from social interaction and growth"*[6]

◻ **computer** → *is* → ◻ **patient with our errors**
   *"The computer role-models a gentle response. It's patient with our errors"*[4]

## Conclusion

This Spencer-Brown inspired ontological model captures the rich theoretical framework of Turkle's "The Second Self." Through formal distinctions (◻) and indications (→), we visualize how Turkle conceptualizes the computer not merely as a tool but as a psychological entity that shapes our self-understanding. The model highlights Turkle's exploration of how computers function as evocative objects that cause us to rethink fundamental questions about what it means to be human, to think, and to feel. It also demonstrates her methodological approach of using interviews with diverse populations—from children to hackers—to reveal the varied ways in which computers enter our psychological and social lives.
