<h2>1. Problem Statement</h2>
<ol>
<li>Auslander, Philip - Liveness (1999)</li>
</ol>
<p>Focused Problem Statement: The common interpretation (L2) of a live concert broadcast on television (L1 Output) as capturing the "real" event (L0 Reality) obscures the extensive mediation and simulation performed by the broadcast system (L1 Machine Layer). Auslander's analysis (L3 Framing) models this "televised liveness" as a culturally constructed effect, questioning the ontological privilege of unmediated presence and revealing how the desire for authenticity (L4 Logic) shapes our reception of mediated performance.</p>
<h2>2. Core Model</h2>
<p><strong>5. Auslander, Philip - Liveness (1999)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>MODEL:</strong> Challenges the traditional opposition between live performance and mediatized recordings, arguing that the concept of "liveness" itself is constructed through media and that audiences often experience mediatized events as live, blurring the ontological distinction.</li>

<h2>4. Spatiotemporal Framework</h2>
<p><strong>5. Auslander, Philip - Liveness (1999)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>◻ SPATIOTEMPORAL UNIVERSE:</strong> Contemporary culture saturated with mediatized events and performances.<ul>
<li><strong>→ [Contains] → ◻ FIELD:</strong> The relationship between live performance and its mediatized representations (recordings, broadcasts).<ul>
<li><strong>→ [Has] → ◻ DOMAIN:</strong> Performance venues, broadcast networks, recording technologies × Audience reception context.</li>
<li><strong>→ [Projects] → ◻ SIGNAL:</strong> Visual and auditory aspects of performance, markers of "liveness" (e.g., immediacy cues, audience sounds), mediatization techniques. (ℝᵏ representing fidelity, temporal markers, audience engagement cues).</li>

<li><strong>→ [Defines] → ◻ OBSERVATION SCALE:</strong> Focus on the reception and cultural construction of "liveness," rather than inherent properties.</li>
<li><strong>→ [Delimits] → ◻ CONTEXT BOUNDARY:</strong> Primarily examines technologically mediated culture, questions the privilege given to unmediated presence.</li>
<li><strong>→ [Generates] → ◻ SAMPLING LATTICE:</strong> Examples of live vs. recorded concerts, television broadcasts, performance documentation, audience discourse about liveness.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>→ [Manifests As] → ◻ PHENOMENON:</strong> Mediatized Liveness – the cultural condition where the concept of "live" is constructed <em>through</em> and often experienced <em>via</em> media, blurring the supposed ontological gap.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>◻ ENGINE:</strong> Deconstructive Analysis.<ul>
<li><strong>→ [Applies] → ◻ TRANSFORM:</strong> Challenging the binary opposition of live/mediated, revealing the cultural construction of "liveness."<ul>
<li><strong>→ [Operates On] → ◻ PATCH:</strong> Specific instances comparing live events and their recordings, audience accounts.</li>
<li><strong>→ [Produces] → ◻ INVARIANT:</strong> The idea that "liveness" is a culturally coded effect, not an essential state; the mutual dependence of live and mediated forms.</li>
<li><strong>→ [Requires] → ◻ CONTRACTION:</strong> Focusing on the <em>effect</em> and <em>perception</em> of liveness, bracketing essentialist ontological claims.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>→ [Constructs] → ◻ REPRESENTATION:</strong> A theoretical model where liveness is contingent, relational, and often produced by mediation itself.</li>
<li><strong>→ [Optimizes] → ◻ RECURSION:</strong> Applying the critique to various forms of performance and media.<ul>
<li><strong>→ [Embeds] → ◻ MODEL:</strong> Derridean deconstruction, theories of representation, media effects.</li>
<li><strong>→ [Projects] → ◻ METRIC:</strong> Degree of perceived authenticity, markers of mediation, audience interpretation (qualitative).</li>
<li><strong>→ [Seeks] → ◻ FIXED POINT:</strong> An understanding where the live/mediated distinction is dissolved or seen as culturally relative.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>◻ METAMODEL:</strong> Theory of Mediatized Performance. Governs the analysis of how technology shapes performance reception. Binds Performance Event DOMAIN ↔ Audience Perception/Cultural Meaning CODMAIN.</li>
<li><strong>Distinctions &amp; Crossings:</strong><ul>
<li><code>◻ MODEL (The cultural construct of "liveness") | ◻ REALITY (The supposed unmediated event)</code> → <code>◻ MEASUREMENT ARTIFACT</code> (The very markers used to identify "reality"/liveness are shown to be part of the mediated model).</li>
<li><code>◻ TIME-LIKE (The event unfolding) | ◻ SPACE-LIKE (The technology of reproduction/broadcast)</code>. The <code>CAUSAL CONE</code> is blurred – does the recording capture the live, or does the possibility of recording shape the live event?</li>
<li><code>◻ CONTINUOUS (The flow of performance) | ◻ DISCRETE (Recording/broadcast segments, identifiable cues of liveness)</code> → <code>◻ SAMPLING THRESHOLD</code> (Media selects and frames aspects of the continuous performance to signify liveness).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Operations:</strong> <code>Observe</code> audience responses and media forms. <code>Encode</code> events based on markers of liveness/mediation. Questions the entanglement of the <code>KERNEL</code> (recording tech) with the <code>PATCH</code> (the performance). Highlights how models <code>Forget</code> their own mediation.</li>
