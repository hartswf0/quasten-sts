# A Spencer-Brown Inspired Ontological Model of Hu's "A Prehistory of the Cloud"

This report presents a structured ontological index of Tung-Hui Hu's influential 2016 work "A Prehistory of the Cloud" using Spencer-Brown's calculus of distinctions. By marking entities as distinctions (◻) and relationships as indications (→), we create a formal representation that illuminates the conceptual architecture of Hu's analysis of cloud computing's material and historical foundations.

## Foundational Entities and Primary Distinctions

### Core Theoretical Constructs

◻ **A Prehistory of the Cloud**: Hu's 2016 book examining the materiality and history behind cloud computing

◻ **the cloud**: Technology that simultaneously exists as ethereal concept and physical infrastructure

◻ **virtualization**: Process of transforming real things into logical objects

◻ **prehistory**: Historical layers beneath seemingly new digital structures

◻ **materiality**: Physical dimension of cloud infrastructure often obscured by rhetoric

◻ **digital environment**: Contemporary technological landscape shaped by historical patterns

◻ **user**: Individual identity unit with economic value in cloud systems

◻ **sovereign power**: Traditional authority transformed within cloud infrastructure

### Historical Network Antecedents

◻ **railroad tracks**: 19th century infrastructure whose routes fiber optic cables later followed

◻ **sewer lines**: Early networked infrastructure serving as metaphorical predecessor

◻ **television circuits**: Broadcast systems anticipating network distributions

◻ **cold war bunkers**: Military facilities later repurposed as data centers

◻ **time-sharing systems**: 1960s-1970s computer systems allowing multiple users to access mainframes

◻ **fiber optic cable**: Physical conduit of internet data often following historical routes

## Morphisms and Relational Structures

### Foundational Relationships

◻ **cloud** → *exceeds* → ◻ **technological platform**
   *"The cloud has exceeded its technological platform and become a potent metaphor for the way contemporary society organizes and understands itself"[2]*

◻ **internet structure** → *resembles* → ◻ **graft on older networks**
   *"The structure of the Internet resembles a graft: a newer network grafted on top of an older, more established network"[2]*

◻ **cloud** → *grafts* → ◻ **digital technologies onto older power structures**
   *"Hu argues that the cloud grafts digital technologies onto older ways of exerting power over a population"[1]*

◻ **fiber optic cables** → *follow* → ◻ **railroad routes**
   *"He notes, for instance, how fiber optic cable lines often follow the same routes as nineteenth-century railroads"[1]*

### Material-Virtual Framework

◻ **cloud** → *is characterized by* → ◻ **gap between virtual and real**
   *"Hu examines the gap between the real and the virtual in our understanding of the cloud"[3]*

◻ **virtualization** → *transforms* → ◻ **real things into logical objects**
   *"The cloud traverses the gap between material and immaterial by performing a sort of rhetorical virtualization, 'turning real things into logical objects'"[2]*

◻ **cloud infrastructure** → *includes* → ◻ **data centers consuming town-sized electricity**
   *"The reality of the cloud is embodied in thousands of massive data centers, any one of which can use as much electricity as a midsized town"[3]*

◻ **cloud** → *appears as* → ◻ **placeless, mute, ethereal**
   *"We may imagine the digital cloud as placeless, mute, ethereal, and unmediated"[3]*

## Complex Conceptual Structures

### User Identity Framework

◻ **time-sharing** → *bestowed* → ◻ **names upon users**
   *"Ever since time-sharing systems bestowed names upon users, those users have been interpellated as units of economic value"[2]*

◻ **user accounts** → *confuse* → ◻ **personal and economic intimacy**
   *"The user account is both a marker of identity and a device for accounting, an odd combination that 'confuses personal intimacy for economic intimacy'"[2]*

◻ **users** → *are atomized as* → ◻ **individuals rather than publics**
   *"The cloud produces users rather than publics"[2]*

◻ **virtualization** → *isolates* → ◻ **users from each other**
   *"Virtualization […] both literally isolates users from each other and also makes manifest an economic system of individual agency"[2]*

### Military-Civilian Connection Framework

◻ **cloud** → *places users close to* → ◻ **mechanism of state violence**
   *"The cloud places users uncomfortably close to the mechanism of state violence"[2]*

◻ **data centers** → *reuse* → ◻ **cold war bunkers**
   *"Cold War bunkers that were later reused as data centers"[3]*

◻ **cloud** → *has* → ◻ **militarized origins and ideology**
   *"But because we invest the cloud with cultural fantasies about security and participation, we fail to recognize its militarized origins and ideology"[3]*

◻ **targeting** → *blurs* → ◻ **data networks and sovereign's right to kill**
   *"The twin meanings of targeting, argues Hu, 'blur the distinction between the regulatory protocols of data networks and the sovereign's right to kill,' resulting in a hybrid form of power that he terms, 'the sovereignty of data'"[2]*

### Power Transformation Framework

◻ **sovereign power** → *mutates inside* → ◻ **cloud**
   *"Sovereign power has mutated and been given new life inside the cloud"[2]*

◻ **nation-states** → *exploit* → ◻ **border-crossing nature of cloud**
   *"Nation-states now exploit the indeterminate, border-crossing nature of the cloud to exceed their political boundaries, exercising power across vast deterritorialized data-spaces"[2]*

◻ **cloud** → *produces* → ◻ **bunker mentality**
   *"The fear of losing one's data (and, thus, one's personhood) gives rise, in his words, to a 'bunker mentality,' a conservative, defensive impulse to retreat underground, awaiting uncertain calamity"[2]*

◻ **military/intelligence** → *benefits from* → ◻ **neoliberal free labor**
   *"The Facebook user and the amateur intelligence agent are both enmeshed in a 'neoliberal system of free labor,' voluntarily producing value for others... while expecting no formal commitment or compensation in return"[2]*

## Conclusion

This Spencer-Brown inspired ontological model captures the rich theoretical framework of Hu's "A Prehistory of the Cloud." Through formal distinctions (◻) and indications (→), we visualize how Hu conceptualizes the cloud not as a radical technological innovation but as a layered historical construct grafted onto older network technologies and power relations. The model highlights Hu's central argument that despite its ethereal imagery, the cloud has material foundations, military origins, and ideological underpinnings that shape how power operates in contemporary digital environments. By examining both infrastructure and metaphor, Hu reveals how cloud computing transforms real things into logical objects, obscuring its physical reality while reinforcing individualistic user identities rather than collective engagement.
