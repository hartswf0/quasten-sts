# A Spencer-Brown Inspired Ontological Model of Bush's "As We May Think"

This report presents a structured ontological index of Vannevar Bush's influential 1945 essay "As We May Think" using Spencer-Brown's calculus of distinctions. By marking entities as distinctions (◻) and relationships as indications (→), we create a formal representation that illuminates the conceptual architecture of Bush's vision for information management and knowledge retrieval.

## Foundational Entities and Primary Distinctions

### Core Theoretical Constructs

◻ **As We May Think**: Bush's 1945 essay examining future information technologies

◻ **memex**: Hypothetical device for storing and associatively retrieving personal information

◻ **information explosion**: Unmanageable growth of scientific knowledge and literature

◻ **scientific isolation**: Problem of specialization preventing cross-disciplinary knowledge

◻ **associative indexing**: Key innovation enabling connections between information items

◻ **trails**: Linked sequences of information representing thought processes

◻ **knowledge accessibility**: Central concern about making information usable

◻ **technological peace dividend**: Redirecting wartime science toward human knowledge enhancement

### Memex Components and Properties

◻ **microfilm storage**: Physical medium for compressing and storing information

◻ **mechanical interface**: Desk-like apparatus with screens and input mechanisms

◻ **code-based indexing**: System for identifying and accessing stored materials

◻ **associative trails**: User-created connections between related materials

◻ **dry photography**: Proposed technology for rapid image creation

◻ **enlargement and reduction**: Methods for managing information scale

◻ **personal library**: Individual collection of stored knowledge and trails

## Morphisms and Relational Structures

### Foundational Relationships

◻ **memex** → *augments* → ◻ **human memory**
   *"A memex is a device in which an individual stores all his books, records, and communications, and which is mechanized so that it may be consulted with exceeding speed and flexibility. It is an enlarged intimate supplement to his memory"*

◻ **associative indexing** → *enables* → ◻ **trails of thought**
   *"The process of tying two items together is the important thing... When numerous items have been thus joined together to form a trail"*

◻ **microfilm** → *compresses* → ◻ **knowledge storage**
   *"Encyclopædia Britannica could be reduced to the volume of a matchbox. A library of a million volumes could be compressed into one end of a desk"*

◻ **trails** → *mimic* → ◻ **human thought patterns**
   *"The human mind... operates by association. With one item in its grasp, it snaps instantly to the next that is suggested by the association of thoughts"*

### Historical Context Framework

◻ **WWII scientific efforts** → *should be redirected toward* → ◻ **peaceful knowledge applications**
   *"This has not been a scientist's war; it has been a war in which all have had a part... What are the scientists to do next?"*

◻ **scientific specialization** → *creates* → ◻ **barriers to knowledge integration**
   *"There is a growing mountain of research... The investigator is staggered by the findings and conclusions of thousands of other workers"*

◻ **information retrieval limitations** → *hinder* → ◻ **scientific progress**
   *"Professionally our methods of transmitting and reviewing the results of research are generations old and by now are totally inadequate for their purpose"*

◻ **technological feasibility** → *now exists for* → ◻ **complex information machines**
   *"The world has arrived at an age of cheap complex devices of great reliability"*

## Complex Conceptual Structures

### Knowledge Management Framework

◻ **associative indexing** → *contrasts with* → ◻ **hierarchical filing systems**
   *"When data of any sort are placed in storage, they are filed alphabetically or numerically... The human mind does not work that way. It operates by association"*

◻ **trails** → *can be* → ◻ **shared between users**
   *"And his trails do not fade. Several years later, his talk with a friend turns to the queer ways in which a people resist innovations, even of vital interest. He has an example, in the fact that the outranged Europeans still failed to adopt the Turkish bow. In fact he has a trail on it"*

◻ **mechanical selection** → *replaces* → ◻ **manual search**
   *"Selection by association, rather than indexing, may yet be mechanized"*

◻ **encyclopedias** → *will evolve into* → ◻ **interconnected knowledge networks**
   *"Wholly new forms of encyclopedias will appear, ready-made with a mesh of associative trails running through them"*

### Technical Implementation Framework

◻ **dry photography** → *enables* → ◻ **immediate image development**
   *"In the future perhaps it need not be wetted at all... An exposure to ammonia gas destroys the unexposed dye, and the picture can then be taken out into the light and examined"*

◻ **microfilm** → *is indexed by* → ◻ **coded symbols**
   *"A single frame is now selected and the code is entered; two tracks on the tape (which are in metal) are pressed together, connecting electrical contacts, whereupon the proper frame is projected onto one of the viewing positions"*

◻ **memex operation** → *requires* → ◻ **user manipulation**
   *"He can add marginal notes and comments... Moreover, he can add to a trail or create a new one by linking a series of items and viewing them together"*

◻ **vocoder technology** → *enables* → ◻ **speech-to-text conversion**
   *"All he needs to do is to take advantage of existing mechanisms and to alter his language"*

### Trail Creation Framework

◻ **memex user** → *creates* → ◻ **personal trails**
   *"The owner of the memex, let us say, is interested in the origin and properties of the bow and arrow. Specifically he is studying why the short Turkish bow was apparently superior to the English long bow in the skirmishes of the Crusades"*

◻ **trail building** → *involves* → ◻ **linking documents by association**
   *"When the user is building a trail, he names it, inserts the name in his code book, and taps it out on his keyboard"*

◻ **trail consultation** → *allows rapid* → ◻ **navigation through information**
   *"Thereafter, at any time, when one of these items is in view, the other can be instantly recalled merely by tapping a button below the corresponding code space"*

◻ **expert trails** → *become* → ◻ **valuable intellectual property**
   *"There is a new profession of trail blazers, those who find delight in the task of establishing useful trails through the enormous mass of the common record"*

## Conclusion

This Spencer-Brown inspired ontological model captures the rich theoretical framework of Bush's "As We May Think." Through formal distinctions (◻) and indications (→), we visualize how Bush conceptualized a future information technology that would extend human memory and overcome limitations in managing expanding knowledge. The model highlights his central innovations of associative indexing and trail creation as alternatives to hierarchical knowledge organization. This structured index reveals why Bush's essay continues to be recognized as a foundational text in the history of information technology, having influenced subsequent developments including hypertext, the World Wide Web, and personal knowledge management systems.
