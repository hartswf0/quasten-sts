# A Spencer-Brown Inspired Ontological Model of Kay and Goldberg's "Personal Dynamic Media"

This report presents a structured ontological index of Alan Kay and Adele Goldberg's influential 1977 work "Personal Dynamic Media" (republished in the New Media Reader, 2003) using Spencer-Brown's calculus of distinctions. By marking entities as distinctions (◻) and relationships as indications (→), we create a formal representation that illuminates the conceptual architecture of their revolutionary vision for personal computing.

## Foundational Entities and Primary Distinctions

### Core Theoretical Constructs

◻ **Personal Dynamic Media**: Kay and Goldberg's 1977 article describing their vision for personal computing

◻ **Dynabook**: Conceptual design for a notebook-sized personal computer accessible to all users

◻ **interim Dynabook**: Prototype implementation used for research and experimentation

◻ **Smalltalk**: Programming language developed to realize Dynabook concepts

◻ **metamedium**: Computer functioning as a medium that can simulate all other media

◻ **Learning Research Group**: Xerox PARC team concerned with knowledge communication and manipulation

### Media Conceptual Framework

◻ **traditional media**: Static forms unable to change in response to viewers

◻ **dynamic media**: Media that can respond to queries and experiments

◻ **simulation**: Representation of an idea that can be manipulated

◻ **two-way conversation**: Interactive exchange between user and computer

◻ **knowledge manipulator**: Self-contained device for information processing

◻ **human sensory systems**: Model for input/output capabilities of the Dynabook

## Morphisms and Relational Structures

### Foundational Relationships

◻ **computer** → *functions as* → ◻ **metamedium**
   *"The computer, viewed as a medium itself, can be all other media if the embedding and viewing methods are sufficiently well provided"[2][3]*

◻ **dynamic media** → *enables* → ◻ **two-way conversation**
   *"This new 'metamedium' is active—it can respond to queries and experiments—so that the messages may involve the learner in a two-way conversation"[2][3]*

◻ **Dynabook** → *is designed for* → ◻ **all ages including children**
   *"We design, build, and use dynamic media which can be used by human beings of all ages"[2][3]*

◻ **Learning Research Group** → *developed* → ◻ **Smalltalk language**
   *"Towards this goal we have designed and built a communications system: the Smalltalk language"[3]*

### Design Framework

◻ **Dynabook** → *is imagined as* → ◻ **size of notebook**
   *"Several years ago, we crystallized our dreams into a design idea for a personal dynamic medium the size of a notebook"[3]*

◻ **Dynabook** → *should have* → ◻ **no discernible pause between cause and effect**
   *"There should be no discernible pause between cause and effect"[2]*

◻ **musical instrument** → *served as* → ◻ **metaphor for Dynabook design**
   *"One of the metaphors we used when designing such a system was that of a musical instrument, such as a flute"[2]*

◻ **Dynabook** → *requires* → ◻ **several hundred times more power than timeshared computing**
   *"These 'civilized' desires for flexibility, resolution, and response lead to the conclusion that a user of a dynamic personal medium needs several hundred times as much power as the average adult now typically enjoys from timeshared computing"[7]*

## Complex Conceptual Structures

### Application Domain Framework

◻ **interim Dynabook** → *allows* → ◻ **text editing**
   *"The Dynabook can be used as an interactive memory or file cabinet. The owner's context can be entered through a keyboard and active editor, retained and modified indefinitely"[3]*

◻ **interim Dynabook** → *allows* → ◻ **drawing and painting**
   *"Drawing and painting can also be done using a pointing device and an iconic editor which allows easy modification of pictures"[3]*

◻ **interim Dynabook** → *allows* → ◻ **musical composition**
   *"A composer could hear his composition while it was in progress"[3]*

◻ **interim Dynabook** → *allows* → ◻ **animation**
   *"A picture is thus a manipulable object and can be animated dynamically by the Dynabook's owner"[3]*

### Font and Display Framework

◻ **Dynabook** → *aims* → ◻ **not to be worse than paper**
   *"One of the goals of the Dynabook's design is not to be worse than paper in any important way"[3]*

◻ **fonts** → *create* → ◻ **different moods**
   *"Different fonts create different moods and cast an aura that influences the subjective style of both writing and reading"[3]*

◻ **custom fonts** → *can be* → ◻ **drawn by users**
   *"The owner can draw in a character font of his own choosing"[3]*

◻ **high-quality characters** → *emerge from* → ◻ **fine grain of display**
   *"With the Dynabook's fine grain of display, the rough edges disappear at normal viewing distance to produce high-quality characters"[3]*

### Educational Framework

◻ **children** → *can learn through* → ◻ **programming**
   *"Kids learning to use the interim Dynabook"[2][3]*

◻ **music learning** → *can bypass* → ◻ **technical skill requirements**
   *"Learning to play music could be aided by being able to capture and hear one's own attempts and compare them against expert renditions. The ability to express music in visual terms which could be filed and played means that the acts of composition and self-evaluation could be learned without having to wait for technical skill in playing"[3]*

◻ **mathematics** → *could become* → ◻ **living language**
   *"Mathematics could become a living language in which children could cause exciting things to happen"[3]*

## Societal Implications Framework

### Vision of Ubiquitous Computing

◻ **Dynabook** → *would create* → ◻ **new world limited only by imagination**
   *"For educators, the Dynabook could be a new world limited only by their imagination and ingenuity"[3]*

◻ **metamedium** → *would contain* → ◻ **wide range of existing and not-yet-invented media**
   *"If such a machine were designed in a way that any owner could mold and channel its power to his own needs, then a new kind of medium would have been created: a metamedium, whose content would be a wide range of already-existing and not-yet-invented media"[3][14]*

◻ **personal computing** → *represents* → ◻ **paradigm shift**
   *"Dr. Kay proposed the concept of the personal computer as a tool to support the intellectual work of individuals, and so initiated a paradigm shift in the computer world"[13]*

◻ **dynamic media** → *was envisioned for* → ◻ **diverse users**
   *"The Dynabook conceived as a computer that could be used freely by anyone - even children - was portable, could be connected to a wireless network"[13]*

## Conclusion

This Spencer-Brown inspired ontological model captures the rich theoretical framework of Kay and Goldberg's "Personal Dynamic Media." Through formal distinctions (◻) and indications (→), we visualize how they conceptualized personal computing as a metamedium capable of simulating all other media while enabling interactive two-way conversations between users and computers. The model highlights their revolutionary vision of the Dynabook as a portable, personal knowledge manipulator accessible to users of all ages, capable of supporting diverse creative activities from text editing to animation and music composition. This structured index reveals why their work continues to be foundational for understanding the evolution of personal computing and interactive media.
