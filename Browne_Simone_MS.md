# A Spencer-Brown Inspired Ontological Model of Browne's "Dark Matters"

This report presents a structured ontological index of Simone Browne's influential 2015 work "Dark Matters: On the Surveillance of Blackness" using Spencer-Brown's calculus of distinctions. By marking entities as distinctions (◻) and relationships as indications (→), we create a formal representation that illuminates the conceptual architecture of Browne's analysis of race and surveillance.

## Foundational Entities and Primary Distinctions

### Core Theoretical Constructs

◻ **Dark Matters**: Browne's 2015 book examining blackness as a key site through which surveillance is practiced

◻ **racializing surveillance**: Mechanism of social control that reifies boundaries along racial lines

◻ **dark sousveillance**: Counter-practices that respond to, challenge, and confront surveillance

◻ **black luminosity**: Concept describing how blackness is made hypervisible through surveillance

◻ **digital epidermalization**: Extension of Fanon's concept to describe biometric technologies

◻ **surveillance**: Both discursive and material practice that polices boundaries

◻ **blackness**: Condition that structures modernity and its institutions of control

### Historical Surveillance Forms

◻ **slave ship design**: Early model of surveillance that prefigured Bentham's Panopticon

◻ **lantern laws**: Required people of color to carry lamps after dark in 18th century

◻ **Book of Negroes**: 18th century ledger documenting former slaves - early biometric record

◻ **branding**: Method of marking enslaved bodies for surveillance

◻ **runaway slave notices**: Textual form of surveillance to recapture escaped slaves

### Contemporary Surveillance Forms

◻ **biometric technologies**: Modern tools for identifying bodies that encode racial difference

◻ **airport security**: Site where racializing surveillance is explicitly practiced

◻ **post-9/11 security practices**: Contemporary surveillance mechanisms with racial dimensions

## Morphisms and Relational Structures

### Foundational Relationships

◻ **surveillance** → *is both* → ◻ **discursive and material practice**
   *"Surveillance, Browne asserts, is both a discursive and material practice that reifies boundaries, borders, and bodies around racial lines"[4]*

◻ **blackness** → *functions as* → ◻ **key site for surveillance**
   *"Browne locates the conditions of blackness as a key site through which surveillance is practiced, narrated, and resisted"[4]*

◻ **contemporary surveillance** → *is informed by* → ◻ **history of racial formation**
   *"She shows how contemporary surveillance technologies and practices are informed by the long history of racial formation"[4]*

◻ **surveillance of blackness** → *persists as* → ◻ **social and political norm**
   *"The surveillance of blackness has long been, and continues to be, a social and political norm"[4]*

### Theoretical Framework

◻ **racializing surveillance** → *reifies* → ◻ **racial boundaries**
   *"Racializing surveillance is a mechanism of social control that concerns how norms pertaining to race are produced and decides what is 'in or out of place'"[2]*

◻ **dark sousveillance** → *responds to* → ◻ **all-encompassing surveillance**
   *"Browne describes dark sousveillance as a tool used to respond to, challenge, and confront all-encompassing surveillance"[2]*

◻ **dark sousveillance** → *includes* → ◻ **rendering oneself out of sight**
   *"Dark sousveillance describes engagements with racializing surveillance where critique of and resistance to it is sustained through strategies of 'rendering one's self out of sight'"[8]*

◻ **blackness** → *functions as* → ◻ **dark matter of surveillance**
   *"'Dark matter' describes the unseen pull of blackness as it structures modernity and its institutions of control"[3]*

## Complex Conceptual Structures

### Historical-Contemporary Framework

◻ **slave ship design** → *prefigured* → ◻ **Panopticon**
   *"Slave ships, auction blocks and plantations, which 'prefigure[ed] Bentham's design of the Panopticon and the seventeenth and eighteenth century disciplinary institutions'"[3]*

◻ **Book of Negroes** → *functioned as* → ◻ **early biometric information technology**
   *"Browne skillfully explains how the information included in the ledger was a form of biometric information technology which, similar to today, was used in the surveillance of black mobilities"[2]*

◻ **slave ships** → *designed to* → ◻ **genderize sexual violence**
   *"Slave ships were designed in a way that exemplified the gendering of sexual violence while simultaneously denying the existence of a woman's ability to resist captivity and surveillance"[2]*

### Intersectional Analysis Framework

◻ **gender** → *intersects with* → ◻ **racializing surveillance**
   *"The fourth chapter also explores the intersection of gender and racializing surveillance by spending significant time on analyzing the experiences of black women, specifically in security theater at the airport"[2]*

◻ **racializing surveillance** → *leads to* → ◻ **discrimination and violence**
   *"Surveillance reifies race, which often leads to discriminatory treatment of those who are negatively racialized"[2]*

◻ **intersectional paradigms** → *recognize that* → ◻ **oppressions work together**
   *"Oppression cannot be reduced to one fundamental type, and that oppressions work together in producing injustice"[9]*

### Theoretical Innovation Framework

◻ **Browne** → *develops* → ◻ **new vocabulary for blackness and power**
   *"Dark Matters is a not only a timely and important intervention in the fields of security and surveillance studies, it is also a powerful and beautifully crafted work of social and cultural theory that develops a new vocabulary for thinking about blackness and power in the contemporary world"[3]*

◻ **dark matter metaphor** → *illuminates* → ◻ **structuring power of blackness**
   *"Dark matter describes the unseen pull of blackness as it structures modernity and its institutions of control"[3]*

◻ **Black Studies** → *enters conversation with* → ◻ **Surveillance Studies**
   *"Browne describes her book as a conversation between Black Studies and Surveillance Studies"[11]*

## Conclusion

This Spencer-Brown inspired ontological model captures the rich theoretical framework of Browne's "Dark Matters." Through formal distinctions (◻) and indications (→), we visualize how Browne conceptualizes the surveillance of blackness from the transatlantic slave trade to contemporary biometric technologies. The model highlights Browne's central argument that surveillance practices have always been racialized, with blackness functioning as both target and structuring force. By introducing concepts like "racializing surveillance" and "dark sousveillance," Browne provides new analytical tools for understanding how surveillance reinforces racial boundaries while also being contested through various resistance practices.
