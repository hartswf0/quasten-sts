# A Spencer-Brown Inspired Ontological Model of Johnson's "Computer Ethics"

This report presents a structured ontological index of Deborah G. Johnson's influential 2009 work "Computer Ethics" (4th edition) using Spencer-Brown's calculus of distinctions. By marking entities as distinctions (◻) and relationships as indications (→), we create a formal representation that illuminates the conceptual architecture of this foundational text in computer ethics.

## Foundational Entities and Primary Distinctions

### Core Theoretical Constructs

◻ **Computer Ethics**: Johnson's 2009 textbook analyzing ethical issues in information technology

◻ **sociotechnical computer ethics**: New approach introduced in the 4th edition, drawing on STS theories

◻ **standard account**: Moor's framework defining computer ethics in terms of policy vacuums and conceptual muddles

◻ **new possibilities**: Component of the standard account - computers create new possibilities for human action

◻ **policy vacuum**: Component of the standard account - lack of policies for new technological situations

◻ **conceptual muddles**: Component of the standard account - confusion around new technological concepts

◻ **information technology (IT)**: Technology for processing, storing, and transmitting information

## Conclusion

This Spencer-Brown inspired ontological model captures the rich theoretical framework of Johnson's "Computer Ethics." Through formal distinctions (◻) and indications (→), we visualize how Johnson conceptualizes computer ethics as a sociotechnical enterprise that recognizes the mutual shaping of technology and society. The model highlights the book's central innovation: moving beyond the standard account to a more nuanced understanding of technology as value-laden and embedded in social contexts. This structured index reveals how Johnson's work integrates ethical theory, sociological analysis, and professional practice to address the distinctive challenges posed by information technology.
