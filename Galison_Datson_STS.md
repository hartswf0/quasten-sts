# A Spencer-Brown Inspired Ontological Model of Daston and Galison's "Objectivity"

This report presents a structured ontological index of Lorraine Daston and Peter Galison's influential 2007 work "Objectivity" using Spencer-Brown's calculus of distinctions. By marking entities as distinctions (◻) and relationships as indications (→), we create a formal representation that illuminates the conceptual architecture of how scientific objectivity evolved across different historical periods.

## Foundational Entities and Primary Distinctions

### Core Theoretical Constructs

◻ **Objectivity**: Daston and Galison's 2007 book examining the history of scientific objectivity

◻ **epistemic virtues**: Ways of securing knowledge that correspond to specific historical periods

◻ **scientific self**: The persona cultivated by scientists that shapes how they pursue knowledge

◻ **scientific atlases**: Compendia of images that teach practitioners what is worth looking at and how

◻ **truth-to-nature**: Epistemic virtue dominant from approximately 1730-1830

◻ **mechanical objectivity**: Epistemic virtue that emerged in the mid-nineteenth century

◻ **trained judgment**: Epistemic virtue that emerged in the twentieth century

### Primary Historical Periods

◻ **Enlightenment era**: Period when truth-to-nature was the dominant epistemic virtue

◻ **mid-nineteenth century**: Historical moment when mechanical objectivity emerged

◻ **twentieth century**: Period when trained judgment supplemented mechanical objectivity

## Morphisms and Relational Structures

### Historical Progression Relationships

◻ **truth-to-nature** → *precedes* → ◻ **mechanical objectivity**
   *Earlier epistemic virtue gave way to a new concept of objectivity*[1][5]

◻ **mechanical objectivity** → *is supplemented by* → ◻ **trained judgment**
   *Later epistemic virtue added to rather than replaced objectivity*[1][12]

◻ **epistemic virtues** → *accumulate rather than replace one another* → ◻ **scientific practice**
   *Different virtues coexist in later periods, with changing emphasis*[2][3]

### Definitional Relationships

◻ **truth-to-nature** → *involves* → ◻ **idealization and standardization**
   *Scientists actively selected and perfected natural forms*[1][5][12]

◻ **mechanical objectivity** → *involves* → ◻ **self-restraint and mechanical reproduction**
   *Scientists suppressed intervention to let "nature speak for itself"*[2][12][13]

◻ **trained judgment** → *involves* → ◻ **expert interpretation of patterns**
   *Scientists used trained intuition to identify meaningful patterns*[2][12]

◻ **epistemic virtues** → *are enforced by* → ◻ **ethos and epistemology**
   *Values both ethical and knowledge-based in character*[4][11]

## Complex Conceptual Structures

### Scientific Self Framework

◻ **scientific self** → *determines* → ◻ **epistemic virtues**
   *Conceptions of the knower shape what counts as proper knowledge*[3][7]

◻ **truth-to-nature** → *cultivates* → ◻ **sage-like scientific self**
   *Wise observer who can discern nature's true forms*[1][5]

◻ **mechanical objectivity** → *cultivates* → ◻ **willfully restrained scientific self**
   *Self-disciplined observer who suppresses subjective judgment*[2][7]

◻ **trained judgment** → *cultivates* → ◻ **expert scientific self**
   *Skilled interpreter who can recognize significant patterns*[2][12]

◻ **scientific self** → *is disciplined through* → ◻ **ethical self-mastery**
   *Scientists cultivate specific forms of self-restraint*[3][7]

### Objectivity's Relationship to Subjectivity

◻ **objectivity** → *opposes* → ◻ **subjectivity**
   *Objectivity emerged as response to fear of subjective contamination*[1][2][7]

◻ **mechanical objectivity** → *seeks to eliminate* → ◻ **personal bias**
   *Technologies like photography used to remove human intervention*[1][13]

◻ **subjectivity** → *is objectivity's evil twin* → ◻ **constitutive relationship**
   *Objectivity defined against what it seeks to overcome*[1]

◻ **mechanical reproduction** → *promises* → ◻ **elimination of subjective judgment**
   *Cameras and self-recording instruments appear to avoid human bias*[1][13]

### Atlas Framework

◻ **scientific atlases** → *define* → ◻ **working objects of science**
   *Publications establish canonical forms for scientific observation*[4][8]

◻ **atlases** → *function to* → ◻ **train the scientific eye**
   *Visual guides that teach practitioners what to see and how*[3][8]

◻ **atlas images** → *reveal* → ◻ **epistemic commitments**
   *Visual representation embodies specific epistemic virtues*[2][4][8]

◻ **atlas makers** → *decide whether to* → ◻ **idealize, mechanically reproduce, or highlight patterns**
   *Different approaches reflect different epistemic commitments*[4][8]

## Theoretical Extensions

### Epistemology and Ethics Connection

◻ **epistemology** → *requires* → ◻ **ethics**
   *Knowledge production involves ethical self-cultivation*[3]

◻ **epistemic fears** → *drive development of* → ◻ **epistemic virtues**
   *Concerns about knowledge going astray shape approaches*[7]

◻ **scientific objectivity** → *embodies* → ◻ **ethical and moral codes**
   *Scientists internalize specific ethical standards*[2][3]

### Contemporary Implications

◻ **objectivity** → *remains* → ◻ **elusive and crucial**
   *Concept continues to hold fundamental importance*[4][8]

◻ **digital imaging** → *creates new challenges for* → ◻ **objectivity**
   *Contemporary technologies raise new questions about representation*[4][8]

◻ **representation** → *evolves toward* → ◻ **presentation**
   *Moving from depicting reality to intervening in it*[9]

## Conclusion

This Spencer-Brown inspired ontological model captures the rich historical framework of Daston and Galison's "Objectivity." Through formal distinctions (◻) and indications (→), we visualize how objectivity emerged as a specific epistemic virtue in the mid-nineteenth century, distinct from the earlier truth-to-nature and later supplemented by trained judgment. The model highlights their central insight that each epistemic virtue corresponds to a particular conception of the scientific self, showing how knowledge practices are inseparable from ethical self-cultivation. The structured index reveals how scientific atlases served as sites where these shifting epistemic commitments became visible, and how the meaning of objectivity has been continuously renegotiated throughout the history of science.
