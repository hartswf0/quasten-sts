# A Spencer-Brown Inspired Ontological Model of Bazin's "The Myth of Total Cinema"

This report presents a structured ontological index of André Bazin's influential 1946/1967 essay "The Myth of Total Cinema" using Spencer-Brown's calculus of distinctions. By marking entities as distinctions (◻) and relationships as indications (→), we create a formal representation that illuminates the conceptual architecture of Bazin's analysis of cinema's guiding myth.

## Foundational Entities and Primary Distinctions

### Core Theoretical Constructs

◻ **The Myth of Total Cinema**: Bazin's essay examining cinema's driving psychological ideal

◻ **total cinema**: Ideal of complete representation of reality that guides technological innovation

◻ **integral realism**: Recreation of the world in its own image, unburdened by artistic interpretation

◻ **cinema**: Idealistic phenomenon conceived before its technical realization

◻ **mechanical reproduction of reality**: 19th century technologies pursuing realistic representation

◻ **guiding myth**: Psychological motivation driving cinema's inventors beyond profit

### Historical Components

◻ **silent film**: Early stage in cinema's technical development

◻ **sound film**: Later stage bringing cinema closer to its mythical origins

◻ **pioneers**: Visionaries who pursued cinema's ideal (Niepce, Lumière, etc.)

◻ **industrialists**: Those primarily concerned with profit rather than the ideal

## Morphisms and Relational Structures

### Core Theoretical Relationships

◻ **cinema** → *is* → ◻ **idealistic phenomenon**
   *"The cinema is an idealistic phenomenon. The concept men had of it existed so to speak fully armed in their minds"*[9]

◻ **total cinema** → *seeks* → ◻ **integral realism**
   *"The guiding myth... is the accomplishment of... an integral realism, a recreation of the world in its own image"*[8]

◻ **idea of cinema** → *precedes* → ◻ **technical invention**
   *"An approximate and complicated visualization of an idea invariably precedes the industrial discovery"*[9]

◻ **preconceived ideas** → *are primary to* → ◻ **technical discoveries**
   *"The basic technical discoveries [are] fortunate accidents... essentially second in importance to the preconceived ideas of the inventors"*[9]

### Historical Development Framework

◻ **silent and sound film** → *are stages of* → ◻ **technical development**
   *"One may legitimately consider the silent and the sound film as stages of a technical development that little by little made a reality out of the original myth"*[8]

◻ **primacy of image** → *is* → ◻ **historically and technically accidental**
   *"The primacy of the image is both historically and technically accidental"*[8]

◻ **pioneers** → *were motivated by* → ◻ **myth of total cinema**
   *"Cinema was born from the convergence of these various obsessions, from a myth, the myth of total cinema"*[5]

◻ **industrialists** → *lacked faith in* → ◻ **cinema's future**
   *"Those who had the least confidence in the future... were precisely the... industrialists"*[5]

## Complex Conceptual Structures

### Paradoxical Development Framework

◻ **new developments** → *take cinema* → ◻ **nearer to its origins**
   *"Every new development added to the cinema must, paradoxically, take it nearer and nearer to its origins"*[8]

◻ **cinema** → *has not yet been* → ◻ **invented**
   *"In short, cinema has not yet been invented!"*[8]

◻ **nostalgia for silent film** → *does not go far enough into* → ◻ **childhood of cinema**
   *"The nostalgia that some still feel for the silent screen does not go far enough back into the childhood of the seventh art"*[8]

◻ **real primitives of cinema** → *exist only in* → ◻ **imaginations of 19th century inventors**
   *"The real primitives of the cinema, existing only in the imaginations of a few men of the nineteenth century, are in complete imitation of nature"*[8]

### Relationship to Reality Framework

◻ **myth of total cinema** → *strives for* → ◻ **complete representation of reality**
   *"Bazin's Myth of Total Cinema refers to the idea that cinema strives for a complete and authentic representation of reality"*[2]

◻ **psychological need** → *motivates* → ◻ **mechanical reproduction of reality**
   *"The myth, the psychological need he identifies, is that of a 'total cinema' aimed at creating a complete illusion of reality"*[12]

◻ **total cinema** → *seeks recreation of world* → ◻ **unburdened by artistic interpretation**
   *"An integral realism, a recreation of the world in its own image, an image unburdened by the freedom of interpretation of the artist"*[8]

◻ **total cinema** → *aims to overcome* → ◻ **irreversibility of time**
   *"An integral realism... unburdened by... the irreversibility of time"*[8]

## Conclusion

This Spencer-Brown inspired ontological model captures the rich theoretical framework of Bazin's "The Myth of Total Cinema." Through formal distinctions (◻) and indications (→), we visualize how Bazin reconceptualizes cinema's development as driven by a psychological myth of integral realism rather than mere technological progress. The model highlights Bazin's paradoxical insight that new developments bring cinema closer to its origins by fulfilling the original dream of complete representation of reality. Finally, it reveals Bazin's provocative claim that "cinema has not yet been invented"—suggesting that the medium continues to evolve toward but never fully realizes its guiding myth of total cinema.
