<h2>1. Problem Statement</h2>
<ol>
<li>Murray, Janet - Hamlet on the Holodeck (1997, revised 2017)</li>
</ol>
<p>Focused Problem Statement: Focusing solely on pre-scripted branching narratives when analyzing game storytelling obscures the emergent narrative potential of highly procedural games like Dwarf Fortress (L1 Machine Layer). While Murray (L3 Framing) emphasizes agency and immersion, analyzing how players (L2) derive narrative from complex simulations modeling systems (L0 Reality) challenges and potentially extends her aesthetic categories, reflecting latent beliefs in procedural expressivity (L4).</p>
<h2>2. Core Model</h2>
<p><strong>31. Murray, Janet - Hamlet on the Holodeck (1997, revised 2017)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>MODEL:</strong> Explores the potential of digital media (computers, interactive environments) as a new narrative medium. Argues that its defining aesthetic properties are immersion, agency, and transformation, allowing for new forms of storytelling that resemble the immersive, participatory experience fantasized in Star Trek's "holodeck."</li>

<li><code>◻ TIME-LIKE (Narrative unfolding based on user agency) | ◻ SPACE-LIKE (Immersive virtual environment, navigable space)</code>. Focuses on the interplay: user actions in space drive narrative time.</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Operations:</strong> <code>Observe</code> interactive digital media. <code>Encode</code> their features based on immersion, agency, transformation. <code>Convolve</code> user actions (<code>PATCH</code>) with procedural rules (<code>KERNEL</code>) to create narrative events (<code>FEATURE</code>). <code>Entangle</code> computation (<code>FEATURE</code>) with aesthetic experience (<code>FEATURE</code>).
