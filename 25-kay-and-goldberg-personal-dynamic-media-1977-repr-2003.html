<h2>1. Problem Statement</h2>
<ol>
<li>Kay and Goldberg - "Personal Dynamic Media" (1977, repr. 2003)</li>
</ol>
<p>Focused Problem Statement: Evaluating visual programming tools like Scratch (L1 Machine Layer) simply on usability obscures their deeper goal, informed by Kay &amp; Goldberg's vision (L3 Framing). The problem is to analyze how Scratch attempts to simulate objects-to-think-with, fostering constructivist learning (L0 Reality) in children (L2 Users), and how effectively it embodies the latent pedagogical assumptions (L4) of "Personal Dynamic Media."</p>
<h2>2. Core Model</h2>
<p><strong>25. Kay and Goldberg - "Personal Dynamic Media" (1977, repr. 2003)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>MODEL:</strong> Envisions the computer not just as a calculation machine but as a "personal dynamic medium" (the Dynabook concept) capable of simulating all other media and serving as a powerful tool for learning, creativity, and communication for individuals, especially children.</li>
<li><strong>Index:</strong><ul>
