# A Spencer-Brown Inspired Ontological Model of Loukissas's "All Data Are Local"

This report presents a structured ontological index of Yanni Alexander Loukissas's influential 2019 work "All Data Are Local: Thinking Critically in a Data-Driven Society" using Spencer-Brown's calculus of distinctions. By marking entities as distinctions (◻) and relationships as indications (→), we create a formal representation that illuminates the conceptual architecture of Loukissas's approach to understanding data in their local contexts.

## Foundational Entities and Primary Distinctions

### Core Theoretical Constructs

◻ **All Data Are Local**: Loukissas's 2019 book challenging the myth of digital universalism

◻ **data setting**: Loukissas's proposed alternative to the concept of a "data set"

◻ **local**: The contexts, practices, and policies related to data's time and place

◻ **data-driven society**: Contemporary social organization increasingly governed by data

◻ **myth of digital universalism**: The misconception that data transcend local contexts

◻ **critical thinking**: Approach to data that considers their embedded nature

◻ **transparency of data**: The misconception that data offer unmediated windows to reality

### Six Principles

◻ **all data are local**: The book's title and first principle establishing data's embeddedness

◻ **data have complex attachments to place**: Second principle exploring spatial dimensions

◻ **data are collected from heterogeneous sources**: Third principle on data's varied origins

◻ **data and algorithms are inextricably entangled**: Fourth principle on computational context

◻ **interfaces recontextualize data**: Fifth principle on mediation of data presentations

◻ **data are indexes to local knowledge**: Sixth principle connecting data to situated understanding

### Case Studies

◻ **Arnold Arboretum**: Harvard botanical collection illustrating data's attachment to place

◻ **Digital Public Library of America**: Platform showing heterogeneity of data sources

◻ **NewsScape**: UCLA Television News Archive demonstrating data-algorithm entanglement

◻ **Zillow**: Real estate marketplace showing how interfaces recontextualize data

## Morphisms and Relational Structures

### Foundational Relationships

◻ **data sets** → *are reconceived as* → ◻ **data settings**
   *"Examining a series of data sources important for understanding the state of public life in the United States...Loukissas shows us how to analyze data settings rather than data sets"[1][4]*

◻ **data** → *are created by* → ◻ **humans and their dutiful machines**
   *"Data are created by humans and their dutiful machines, at a time, in a place, with the instruments at hand, for audiences that are conditioned to receive them"[1][2]*

◻ **data set** → *implies but is not* → ◻ **something discrete, complete, and portable**
   *"The term data set implies something discrete, complete, and portable, but it is none of those things"[1][2]*

◻ **Loukissas** → *rebuts* → ◻ **myth of digital universalism**
   *"Rebutting the 'myth of digital universalism,' Loukissas reminds us of the meaning-making power of the local"[1]*

### Case Study Relationships

◻ **Arnold Arboretum accessions data** → *demonstrates* → ◻ **complex attachments to place**
   *"The accessions data of the Arnold Arboretum can help us understand, first and foremost, that data have complex attachments to place, which invisibly structure their form and interpretation"[3]*

◻ **DPLA** → *illustrates* → ◻ **heterogeneous data sources**
   *"The DPLA can help us see that data are collected from heterogeneous sources, each with their own local attachments"[3]*

◻ **NewsScape** → *reveals* → ◻ **data-algorithm entanglement**
   *"NewsScape offers an opportunity to learn how data and algorithms are entangled, with far-reaching implications for what it may mean to be informed in the future"[3]*

◻ **Zillow** → *demonstrates* → ◻ **interface recontextualization**
   *"The case of Zillow shows how interfaces recontextualize data, with striking consequences for the value that we place on our homes and those of others"[3]*

## Complex Conceptual Structures

### Local Knowledge Framework

◻ **locality** → *is a relative designation* → ◻ **with multiple meanings**
   *"I use the term local, further explained in the next chapter, as a relative designation"[3]*

◻ **local knowledge** → *contrasts with* → ◻ **"view from nowhere"**
   *"For students and scholars, attention to the local offers an opportunity to compare diverse cultures through the data that they make or use"[3]*

◻ **local attachment** → *ranges from* → ◻ **place-specific to infrastructure-based**
   *"Each case offers an opportunity to incrementally explore and elaborate on what local can mean in relationship to data: from a form of place attachment...to the traces of such attachments found in the accumulated sources of data infrastructures"[3]*

◻ **interface economy** → *supplants* → ◻ **local meaning-making**
   *"Companies in today's 'interface economy' seek to make data accessible and actionable anywhere. In doing so, they both obscure and then supplant the traditional meaning-making power of the local"[3]*

### Methodological Framework

◻ **Loukissas's approach** → *combines* → ◻ **qualitative research and data visualizations**
   *"To make his argument, Loukissas employs a combination of qualitative research on data cultures and exploratory data visualizations"[1][2]*

◻ **critical thinking about data** → *becomes* → ◻ **basis for ethical design**
   *"Critical thinking about data is poised to become the new basis for identifying effective and ethical design"[3]*

◻ **counterdata** → *challenges* → ◻ **normative algorithms**
   *"Loukissas suggests what for me is precisely the appropriate response: we must create counterdata to challenge normative algorithms"[3]*

### Museum Guards Example

◻ **museum guards** → *provide* → ◻ **insight about data contexts**
   *"The guards proved to be among the best sources of insight about the potential contexts of data use within the American Wing galleries"[7]*

◻ **museum information structure** → *excludes* → ◻ **guards**
   *"The museum guards (who were not regarded as part of the information structure of the Museum by the curators)"[7]*

◻ **guards** → *know* → ◻ **visitor behavior**
   *"The guards knew better than anyone what visitors do: how they move, where they go, and even why they get lost"[7]*

## Theoretical Implications and Connections

### Applications of Local Data Thinking

◻ **local perspectives** → *awaken* → ◻ **social advocacy**
   *"Local perspectives on data can awaken new forms of social advocacy. For wherever data are used, local communities of producers, users, and even nonusers are affected"[3]*

◻ **understanding data locally** → *is* → ◻ **thinking critically**
   *"When confronted with the task of understanding a new data set, thinking locally is thinking critically"[3]*

◻ **book audience** → *includes* → ◻ **designers, scholars, and general readers**
   *"I wrote All Data Are Local from the position of this dual allegiance, and my hope is that the book will resonate with colleagues in both fields. For designers, it is a primer on the social lives of data. For scholars, it demonstrates how design can extend and embody the work of sociotechnical studies"[3]*

◻ **data availability** → *is not* → ◻ **permission for distance**
   *"The invocation at the end of the book is a clarion cry for our times: 'Do not mistake the availability of data as permission to remain at a distance'"[3]*

## Conclusion

This Spencer-Brown inspired ontological model captures the rich theoretical framework of Loukissas's "All Data Are Local." Through formal distinctions (◻) and indications (→), we visualize how Loukissas reconceptualizes data not as discrete, portable entities but as deeply embedded in their local contexts of creation and use. The model highlights the book's six guiding principles and illustrates them through four major case studies, revealing how Loukissas challenges the myth of digital universalism and proposes a critical approach to data that acknowledges their situated nature. This structured index provides an entry point into Loukissas's argument for the meaning-making power of the local in our increasingly data-driven society.
