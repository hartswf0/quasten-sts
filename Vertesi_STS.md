# A Spencer-Brown Inspired Ontological Model of "digitalSTS: A Field Guide for Science & Technology Studies"

This report presents a structured ontological index of Janet Vertesi and David Ribes' influential 2019 edited volume "digitalSTS: A Field Guide for Science & Technology Studies" using Spencer-Brown's calculus of distinctions. By marking entities as distinctions (◻) and relationships as indications (→), we create a formal representation that illuminates the conceptual architecture of this groundbreaking contribution to digital scholarship in Science and Technology Studies.

## Morphisms and Relational Structures

### Foundational Relationships

◻ **digitalSTS** → *responds to* → ◻ **changing technological situations**
   *"We must admit that our situations have changed... the textures of scientific and daily life at the beginning of the 21st century are suffused with online platforms and heterogenous informational environments"*[3]

◻ **digitalSTS** → *bridges* → ◻ **STS and digital studies**
   *"This volume therefore extends this conversation and broadens our field's scope to include voices from scholars engaged in digital studies across many fields"*[3]

◻ **digitalSTS** → *refreshes* → ◻ **STS canon**
   *"This groundbreaking collection brings together a world-class group of contributors to refresh the canon for contemporary digital scholarship"*[1]

◻ **digitalSTS** → *requires* → ◻ **interdisciplinary collaboration**
   *"The chapters combine approaches, topics, artifacts, and literatures from multiple disciplines to demonstrate their relevance for STS scholarship"*[3]

### Theoretical Framework

◻ **core STS principles** → *are applied to* → ◻ **digital phenomena**
   *"What sets this volume apart is its continued commitment to core STS principles as deployed in the analysis of digital systems and interactions"*[3]

◻ **digital methodological inquiry** → *must be* → ◻ **reflexive**
   *"Another goal for this volume is to provide examples of a kind of reflexive, digital methodological inquiry"*[3]

◻ **technology** → *is not treated as* → ◻ **merely an object of investigation**
   *"They do so through exploring once-familiar sites reconfigured by digital technologies, by investigations that grapple with novel tools, and through efforts that tackle design and making rather than treating technology as (only) an object of social and humanistic investigation"*[3]

## Complex Conceptual Structures

### Core Questions Framework

◻ **digital fieldwork** → *raises question* → ◻ **"What is revealed when the 'shop floor' goes digital?"**
   *"What is revealed about laboratory life when the 'shop floor' goes digital?"*[3]

◻ **online communication** → *raises question* → ◻ **"What happens when new constituences come together online?"**
   *"What can we learn about expertise when new constituencies of laypeople come together online at great distances?"*[3]

◻ **digital objects** → *raise question* → ◻ **"How do we incorporate computational artifacts into agency concepts?"**
   *"How do we incorporate computational artifacts like bots, algorithms, and hidden taxonomies into our extant concepts of distributed or hybrid agency?"*[3]

◻ **digital materiality** → *raises question* → ◻ **"How do theories of materiality map onto digital objects?"**
   *"And how do our theories of materiality map onto digital objects and practices, and vice versa?"*[3]

### Organizational Framework

◻ **Materiality section** → *includes* → ◻ **essays on digital materiality**
   *"Unfolding Digital Materiality: How Engineers Struggle to Shape Tangible and Fluid Objects"*[12]

◻ **Materiality section** → *explores* → ◻ **life and death of data**
   *"The Life and Death of Data"*[12]

◻ **Gender section** → *examines* → ◻ **diversity in tech**
   *"If 'Diversity' Is the Answer, What Is the Question? Understanding Diversity Advocacy in Voluntaristic Technology Projects"*[12]

◻ **Gender section** → *investigates* → ◻ **feminist perspectives in computing**
   *"Feminist STS and Ubiquitous Computing: Investigating the Nature of the 'Nature' of Ubicomp"*[12]

### Methodological Framework

◻ **STS approach** → *resists* → ◻ **unreflexive use of formal tools**
   *"STS has been slow to take up these techniques largely due to our resistance to the unreflexive use of systematizing or formal tools and methods"*[3]

◻ **digitalSTS** → *provides* → ◻ **examples of reflexive digital methods**
   *"Another goal for this volume is to provide examples of a kind of reflexive, digital methodological inquiry"*[3]

◻ **digital methods** → *require* → ◻ **archaeological examination**
   *"In sum, the sentiment is that STS cannot incorporate the configurations of epistemic tools and methods offered by digital media...without some (even if inevitably incomplete) archaeology of these tools' assumptions, methods"*[3]

## Conclusion

This Spencer-Brown inspired ontological model captures the rich theoretical framework of "digitalSTS: A Field Guide for Science & Technology Studies." Through formal distinctions (◻) and indications (→), we visualize how Vertesi and Ribes conceptualize the intersection of science and technology studies with digital phenomena. The model highlights the volume's commitment to applying core STS principles to digital contexts while recognizing the need for methodological innovation and reflexivity. By organizing contributions around theory, methods, and making, digitalSTS provides both continuity with STS traditions and pathways for engaging with contemporary computational realities.
