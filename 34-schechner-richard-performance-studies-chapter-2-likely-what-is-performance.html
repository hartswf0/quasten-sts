<h2>1. Problem Statement</h2>
<ol>
<li>Schechner, Richard - Performance Studies, Chapter 2 (likely "What is Performance?")</li>
</ol>
<p>Focused Problem Statement: Defining performance strictly by traditional theatrical or ritual frames (L4 Taxonomy) obscures the performativity of online streaming on Twitch (L1 Platform/Performance). Schechner's concept of 'restored behavior' (L3 Framing) allows modeling how streamers (L2 Performers) utilize practiced techniques to simulate intimacy and presence, blurring everyday behavior and framed performance (L0 Reality) for their audience (L2 Audience).</p>
<h2>2. Core Model</h2>
<p><strong>34. Schechner, Richard - Performance Studies, Chapter 2 (1988/2002)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>MODEL:</strong> Defines performance broadly to encompass ritual, play, arts, and everyday life, centering on the concept of "restored behavior" (or "twice-behaved behavior")—physical or verbal actions that are learned, rehearsed, and repeatable, allowing them to be stored, transmitted, and transformed across contexts.</li>
<li><strong>Index:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>◻ Performance (Broad Definition: Ritual, Play, Art, Everyday Life)</strong></li>
<li><strong>◻ Performance</strong> → <strong>◻ Based on Restored Behavior (Twice-Behaved Behavior)</strong></li>
<li><strong>◻ Restored Behavior</strong> → <strong>◻ Actions (Learned, Rehearsed, Repeatable)</strong></li>
<li><strong>◻ Restored Behavior</strong> → <strong>◻ Allows Storage/Transmission/Transformation of Actions</strong></li>
</ul>

<h2>4. Spatiotemporal Framework</h2>

<li><strong>→ [Has] → ◻ DOMAIN:</strong> Rituals, theatre, dance, music, play, sports, everyday life performances (greetings, lectures), social roles × Cultural and historical settings.</li>
<li><strong>→ [Projects] → ◻ SIGNAL:</strong> Observable actions (gestures, speech), symbolic artifacts, spatial arrangements, temporal structures, audience reactions. (ℝᵏ representing repeatability, framing cues, performer/audience interaction).</li>
<li><strong>→ [Admits] → ◻ PERTURBATION:</strong> Improvisation within structures, changes in cultural framing, transgression of performance boundaries, mediation of performance.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>→ [Observed Through] → ◻ WINDOW:</strong> Performance Studies perspective (interdisciplinary: anthropology, theatre, sociology), focus on process and behavior, broad definition of performance.<ul>
<li><strong>→ [Defines] → ◻ OBSERVATION SCALE:</strong> Ranges from micro-analysis of specific interactions to macro-analysis of large-scale rituals or cultural performances. Focus on "restored behavior."</li>
<li><strong>→ [Delimits] → ◻ CONTEXT BOUNDARY:</strong> Includes aesthetics, ritual, and everyday life under the umbrella of "performance"; emphasizes the "twice-behaved" nature of performed actions.</li>
<li><strong>→ [Generates] → ◻ SAMPLING LATTICE:</strong> Analysis of theatre rehearsals, shamanic rituals, sporting events, political rallies, everyday social interactions, performance art.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>→ [Manifests As] → ◻ PHENOMENON:</strong> Performance as Restored Behavior – Performance is a fundamental mode of human activity characterized by "restored behavior" or "twice-behaved behavior": physical/verbal/virtual actions that are not done for the first time but are practiced, rehearsed, repeatable segments of behavior that can be rearranged and performed with awareness. Performance exists on a continuum from efficacious ritual to entertaining theatre.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>◻ ENGINE:</strong> Performance Analysis / Identification of Restored Behavior.<ul>
<li><strong>→ [Applies] → ◻ TRANSFORM:</strong> Analyzing any human action or event through the lens of performance, identifying elements of restored behavior, framing, and audience interaction.<ul>
<li><strong>→ [Operates On] → ◻ PATCH:</strong> Specific instances of behavior (ritual action, theatrical scene, everyday greeting).</li>
<li><strong>→ [Produces] → ◻ INVARIANT:</strong> The concept of "restored behavior"; the performance process (rehearsal, performance, aftermath); the efficacy-entertainment continuum.</li>
<li><strong>→ [Requires] → ◻ CONTRACTION:</strong> Focusing on the behavioral and processual aspects of actions, regardless of traditional genre boundaries (art vs. life vs. ritual).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>→ [Constructs] → ◻ REPRESENTATION:</strong> A broad, inclusive framework for analyzing human behavior as performance.</li>
<li><strong>→ [Optimizes] → ◻ RECURSION:</strong> Applying the performance studies lens to an ever-wider range of human activities.<ul>
<li><strong>→ [Embeds] → ◻ MODEL:</strong> Anthropological theories of ritual (Turner), theatre studies, sociological interactionism (Goffman), theories of play.</li>
<li><strong>→ [Projects] → ◻ METRIC:</strong> Degree of restored behavior, clarity of framing, position on efficacy-entertainment axis, performer-audience dynamic (qualitative/descriptive).</li>
<li><strong>→ [Seeks] → ◻ FIXED POINT:</strong> Understanding diverse human activities as fundamentally performative.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>◻ METAMODEL:</strong> Theory of Performance Studies. Governs the analysis of human behavior as performance. Binds Segments of Behavior DOMAIN ↔ Cultural Performance (Ritual, Theatre, Everyday Life) CODMAIN via the process of restoration/rehearsal.</li>
<li><strong>Distinctions &amp; Crossings:</strong><ul>
<li><code>◻ MODEL (Performance Studies framework/Restored Behavior) | ◻ REALITY (Fluid stream of human action)</code> → <code>◻ MEASUREMENT ARTIFACT</code> (The framework isolates segments of behavior as "restored," an analytical artifact highlighting the performative dimension).</li>
<li><code>◻ TIME-LIKE (The performance event unfolding, rehearsal process) | ◻ SPACE-LIKE (Performance venue, framing, spatial relationships)</code>. Performance intrinsically structures time and space.</li>
<li><code>◻ CONTINUOUS (Flow of behavior) | ◻ DISCRETE (Units of restored behavior, performance frames)</code> → <code>◻ SAMPLING THRESHOLD</code> (Performance analysis identifies discrete repeatable units within the continuous flow).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Operations:</strong> <code>Observe</code> human behavior across contexts. <code>Encode</code> actions based on whether they constitute restored behavior and how they are framed. <code>Entangle</code> seemingly disparate activities (ritual, theatre, everyday life) (<code>FEATURE</code>s) through the common lens of performance. Resists <code>Forget</code>ting the embodied, processual nature of behavior.</li>
