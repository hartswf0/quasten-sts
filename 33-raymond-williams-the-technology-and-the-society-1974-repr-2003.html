<h2>1. Problem Statement</h2>
<ol>
<li>Raymond Williams - “The technology and the society” (1974, repr. 2003)</li>
</ol>
<p>Focused Problem Statement: Technologically determinist accounts framing 5G (L1 Machine Layer) as inevitably causing specific societal changes obscure the complex social shaping process highlighted by Williams (L3 Framing). The problem is to analyze how prior social intentions (economic, political - L0 Reality) held by corporations and governments (L2 Actors) influenced 5G's technical standards and deployment, revealing the latent social forces (L4) masked by deterministic narratives.</p>
<h2>2. Core Model</h2>
<p><strong>33. Raymond Williams - “The technology and the society” (1974, repr. 2003)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>MODEL:</strong> Critiques technological determinism (the idea that technology drives social change), arguing instead that technological development is shaped by social, economic, and political intentions and decisions ("determinism of technology by society"), and technologies are then incorporated and used according to existing social structures and needs.</li>

<h2>4. Spatiotemporal Framework</h2>
<p><strong>33. Raymond Williams - “The technology and the society” (1974, repr. 2003)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>◻ SPATIOTEMPORAL UNIVERSE:</strong> History of technological development and its relationship to social change, particularly focusing on broadcast media (TV).<ul>
<li><strong>→ [Contains] → ◻ FIELD:</strong> The processes of technological invention, development, diffusion, and use within specific social, economic, and political contexts.<ul>
<li><strong>→ [Has] → ◻ DOMAIN:</strong> Technological hardware, scientific knowledge, social needs (perceived or constructed), economic investment, political decisions, cultural forms × Historical periods.</li>
<li><strong>→ [Projects] → ◻ SIGNAL:</strong> Specific technologies (e.g., television), patterns of media use, dominant cultural forms shaped by technology, discourses about technology's impact. (ℝᵏ representing adoption rates, content types, stated intentions vs. outcomes).</li>
<li><strong>→ [Admits] → ◻ PERTURBATION:</strong> Unintended consequences of technology, user adaptations/resistance, shifts in social priorities or economic conditions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>→ [Observed Through] → ◻ WINDOW:</strong> Cultural Materialism, critique of technological determinism, historical analysis of social shaping of technology.<ul>
<li><strong>→ [Defines] → ◻ OBSERVATION SCALE:</strong> Focus on the complex interplay of social forces <em>behind</em> technological development, rather than seeing technology as an autonomous force.</li>
<li><strong>→ [Delimits] → ◻ CONTEXT BOUNDARY:</strong> Rejects simple cause-effect models (tech → society), emphasizes social intentions, economic motives, and political decisions <em>driving</em> technological paths. Uses TV as a key case study.</li>
<li><strong>→ [Generates] → ◻ SAMPLING LATTICE:</strong> Historical analysis of the preconditions for television, the intentions behind its development (military, commercial), its incorporation into existing social structures (home, family).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>→ [Manifests As] → ◻ PHENOMENON:</strong> Social Shaping of Technology (Critique of Tech. Determinism) – Technological development is not an autonomous process that impacts society from the outside. Rather, technologies are actively researched, developed, and implemented based on existing social needs, intentions (economic, military, political), and power structures. Society "determines" technology as much as, or more than, technology determines society. Effects arise from use within social contexts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>◻ ENGINE:</strong> Historical Materialist Analysis / Critique of Determinism.<ul>
<li><strong>→ [Applies] → ◻ TRANSFORM:</strong> Analyzing the history of a technology (like TV) to reveal the social, economic, and political intentions and decisions that shaped its emergence and form.<ul>
<li><strong>→ [Operates On] → ◻ PATCH:</strong> Specific technological developments, historical accounts of invention/diffusion, stated aims of developers/investors.</li>
<li><strong>→ [Produces] → ◻ INVARIANT:</strong> The principle of the social shaping of technology; identification of the specific social intentions driving a technology's development; critique of technological determinism as simplistic.</li>
<li><strong>→ [Requires] → ◻ CONTRACTION:</strong> Looking behind the technology itself to the complex social processes that led to it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>→ [Constructs] → ◻ REPRESENTATION:</strong> A model where technology is seen as symptomatic of social forces and its effects are contingent on social use, not inherent in the tech itself.</li>
<li><strong>→ [Optimizes] → ◻ RECURSION:</strong> Applying the social shaping analysis to different technologies and historical contexts.<ul>
<li><strong>→ [Embeds] → ◻ MODEL:</strong> Cultural Materialism, Marxist emphasis on social relations of production (adapted), historical research methods.</li>
<li><strong>→ [Projects] → ◻ METRIC:</strong> Identification of social intentions, influence of economic/political factors, gap between intended and actual use (qualitative/historical).</li>
<li><strong>→ [Seeks] → ◻ FIXED POINT:</strong> A nuanced understanding of technology as socially embedded and historically contingent, avoiding deterministic explanations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>◻ METAMODEL:</strong> Theory of Social Shaping of Technology. Governs the historical analysis of technological development. Binds Social Needs/Intentions/Power Structures DOMAIN ↔ Technological Form/Development/Use CODMAIN.</li>
<li><strong>Distinctions &amp; Crossings:</strong><ul>
<li><code>◻ MODEL (Technological Determinist view) | ◻ REALITY (Complex social shaping process)</code> → <code>◻ MEASUREMENT ARTIFACT</code> (Williams argues Tech Determinism is a misleading model/artifact obscuring the real social forces at play).</li>
<li><code>◻ TIME-LIKE (Historical development process) | ◻ SPACE-LIKE (Social structures, geographical diffusion)</code>. Focuses on the <code>TIME-LIKE</code> process of development driven by <code>SPACE-LIKE</code> social structures and intentions.</li>
<li><code>◻ CONTINUOUS (Social processes, needs) | ◻ DISCRETE (Specific inventions, technological systems)</code> → <code>◻ SAMPLING THRESHOLD</code> (Analyzes discrete technological outcomes as results of continuous social processes and decisions).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Operations:</strong> <code>Observe</code> technological history and surrounding social context. <code>Encode</code> technological development as driven by social intentions. Critiques <code>Entangle</code>ments proposed by determinism (tech → effect). Emphasizes the need not to <code>Forget</code> the social context and agency in technological history.</li>
