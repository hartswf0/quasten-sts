# A Spencer-Brown Inspired Ontological Model of Bordwell's "Post-Theory"

This report presents a structured ontological index of David Bordwell and Noël Carroll's influential 1996 work "Post-Theory: Reconstructing Film Studies" using Spencer-Brown's calculus of distinctions. By marking entities as distinctions (◻) and relationships as indications (→), we create a formal representation that illuminates the conceptual architecture of their challenge to dominant film theory paradigms.

## Foundational Entities and Primary Distinctions

### Core Theoretical Constructs

◻ **Post-Theory**: Bordwell and Carroll's 1996 book/approach challenging monolithic film theory

◻ **Grand Theory**: Aggregate of doctrines that dominated film studies (also called "SLAB Theory")

◻ **piecemeal theorizing**: Using theories tailored to specific goals rather than a unified theory

◻ **cognitivist stance**: Approach emphasizing empirical research and cognitive understanding

◻ **SLAB Theory**: Pejorative term for doctrines derived from Saussure, Lacan, Althusser, and Barthes

◻ **methodological pluralism**: Employing multiple theoretical frameworks based on specific goals

◻ **film scholarship**: Academic study of cinema that Bordwell and Carroll aim to reconstruct

### Historical Components

◻ **1970s-1980s**: Period when film studies was dominated by Grand Theory

◻ **post-Theory age**: Era declared by Bordwell and Carroll in 1996

◻ **psychoanalytic framework**: Dominant paradigm in film studies that Post-Theory challenges

◻ **traditional film studies**: Approach challenged by cognitivist perspective

## Morphisms and Relational Structures

### Foundational Relationships

◻ **Grand Theory** → *was challenged by* → ◻ **Post-Theory**
   *"With Post-Theory, David Bordwell and Noël Carroll challenge the prevailing practices of film scholarship"*[3]

◻ **Bordwell and Carroll** → *declared* → ◻ **post-Theory age**
   *"In 1996, David Bordwell and Noël Carroll famously declared that the discipline of film studies had entered the 'post-Theory' age"*[1]

◻ **Post-Theory** → *advocates for* → ◻ **piecemeal theorizing**
   *"Bordwell and Carroll pose a simple question. Why not employ many theories tailored to specific goals, rather than searching for a unified theory"*[6]

◻ **Post-Theory** → *rejects* → ◻ **psychoanalytic framework**
   *"The only commonality to be found among the works, they insist... is that no author relies upon what Bordwell calls 'Grand Theory'"*[5]

### Methodological Framework

◻ **piecemeal theorizing** → *focuses on* → ◻ **specific problems**
   *"Against the unifying paradigm of 'Grand Theory,' Bordwell and Carroll contrasted the use of piecemeal theories tied to case studies and based on empirical research"*[9]

◻ **Post-Theory** → *promotes* → ◻ **empirical research**
   *"This 'generalization,' however, should emerge from observation, pass through a hypothesis and then be verified in concrete terms"*[9]

◻ **cognitivist stance** → *differs between* → ◻ **Bordwell and Carroll**
   *"They themselves disagree on the exact nature of the cognitivist 'stance'"*[5]

◻ **Post-Theory** → *aims to* → ◻ **reconstruct film studies**
   *"Post-Theory promises to redefine the study of cinema"*[3]

## Complex Conceptual Structures

### Theoretical Challenges Framework

◻ **Grand Theory** → *is characterized as* → ◻ **"doctrines derived from Lacanian psychoanalysis, structuralist semiotics, poststructuralist literary theory, and variants of Althusserian Marxism"**
   *"'Grand Theory' (or, more pejoratively, 'SLAB Theory,' for Saussure, Lacan, Althusser, and Barthes [Bordwell 1989]) and which Bordwell and Carroll defined as that 'aggregate of doctrines derived from Lacanian psychoanalysis, structuralist semiotics, poststructuralist literary theory, and variants of Althusserian Marxism'"*[1]

◻ **Post-Theory** → *claims that* → ◻ **film studies needs no determining philosophical assumptions**
   *"Bordwell, as bluntly as the positivists a half-century before him, insists that film studies 'need carry no determining philosophical assumptions about subjectivity or culture, no univocal metaphysical or epistemological or political presumptions – in short, no commitment to Grand Theory'"*[5]

◻ **Post-Theory** → *is criticized as* → ◻ **"the old positivism in drag"**
   *"The new 'cognitivism' in film studies is the old positivism in drag: different costume, same intent"*[5]

◻ **theorizing** → *should be* → ◻ **dialectical**
   *"The method of film studies must rather be 'dialectical', demolishing previous arguments with better ones"*[5]

### Book Structure Framework

◻ **Post-Theory** → *is divided into* → ◻ **four sections**
   *"The book is divided into four sections: The Current State of Film Studies, Film Theory and Aesthetics, Psychology of Film, and History and Analysis"*[11]

◻ **Post-Theory** → *includes essays on* → ◻ **diverse topics**
   *"Post-Theory offers fresh directions for understanding film, presenting new essays by twenty-seven scholars on topics as diverse as film scores, audience response, and the national film industries of Russia, Scandinavia, the U.S., and Japan"*[3]

◻ **essays** → *tackle* → ◻ **basic issues in film**
   *"They use historical, philosophical, psychological, and feminist methods to tackle such basic issues as: What goes on when viewers perceive a film? How do filmmakers exploit conventions? How do movies create illusions? How does a film arouse emotion?"*[3]

### Critics and Reception Framework

◻ **critics** → *accuse Post-Theory of* → ◻ **positivism**
   *"The answer is obvious: since the alternative candidates for 'reconstructing film studies' acknowledge the impressive and well examined 'Grand Theories' upon which they rest, rather than denying their centrality, they can have no place within a redressed positivism"*[5]

◻ **Post-Theory** → *opened the door to* → ◻ **alternative voices**
   *"With Post-Theory, David Bordwell and Noel Carroll have opened the floor to other voices challenging the prevailing practices of film scholarship"*[6]

◻ **Bordwell's approach** → *has* → ◻ **empirical dimension**
   *"Another strength of Bordwell's approach is that it has an empirical dimension and it links theory to practical criticism"*[7]

## Conclusion

This Spencer-Brown inspired ontological model captures the rich theoretical framework of Bordwell and Carroll's "Post-Theory." Through formal distinctions (◻) and indications (→), we visualize how they conceptualized a challenge to the dominant Grand Theory paradigm in film studies. The model highlights their advocacy for piecemeal theorizing, methodological pluralism, and empirical research as alternatives to unified theoretical frameworks. It also reveals the criticisms they faced, particularly claims that their cognitivist approach resembled positivism. This structured index provides an entry point into understanding the significant impact of "Post-Theory" on film scholarship and its continuing relevance to debates about methodology in the humanities[1][3][5][9].
