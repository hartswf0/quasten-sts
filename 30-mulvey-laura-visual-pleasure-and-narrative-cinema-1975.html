<h2>1. Problem Statement</h2>
<ol>
<li>Mulvey, Laura - “Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema” (1975)</li>
</ol>
<p>Focused Problem Statement: Applying Mulvey's original "Male Gaze" theory (L3 Framing) rigidly to contemporary films like Portrait of a Lady on Fire may obscure how female filmmakers (L2/L3) manipulate cinematic conventions (L1 Machine Layer) precisely to model female subjectivity and desire (L0 Reality) differently. The problem is to analyze how such films potentially challenge the latent psychoanalytic assumptions and monolithic spectator model (L4) of Mulvey's initial formulation.</p>
<h2>2. Core Model</h2>
<p><strong>30. Mulvey, Laura - “Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema” (1975)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>MODEL:</strong> Uses psychoanalytic theory (Freud, Lacan) to argue that mainstream narrative cinema is structured around patriarchal unconscious desires, positioning the spectator to derive visual pleasure through a "male gaze" that objectifies the female figure (scopophilia) or identifies with the male protagonist controlling the narrative (narcissism).</li>

<h2>4. Spatiotemporal Framework</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>◻ SPATIOTEMPORAL UNIVERSE:</strong> Patriarchal society and its cultural expressions, specifically Classical Hollywood cinema.<ul>
<li><strong>→ [Contains] → ◻ FIELD:</strong> The structure of narrative cinema and its relationship to unconscious desires, pleasure, and gender dynamics.<ul>
<li><strong>→ [Has] → ◻ DOMAIN:</strong> Cinematic codes (camera work, editing, mise-en-scène), narrative structures, character functions (male protagonist, female object), spectator positioning × Psychoanalytic structures (unconscious, scopophilia, narcissism, castration anxiety).</li>
<li><strong>→ [Projects] → ◻ SIGNAL:</strong> Images of women as spectacle, narrative driven by male action/gaze, camera movements identifying with male POV, editing patterns controlling the look. (ℝᵏ representing shot duration, POV identification, narrative centrality).</li>
<li><strong>→ [Admits] → ◻ PERTURBATION:</strong> Avant-garde cinema attempting to break patriarchal codes, female spectators' complex identifications, later feminist film theory refinements.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>→ [Observed Through] → ◻ WINDOW:</strong> Psychoanalytic theory (Freud, Lacan), feminist theory, semiotics of cinema.<ul>
<li><strong>→ [Defines] → ◻ OBSERVATION SCALE:</strong> Analysis of the underlying psychic structures and ideological functions embedded in the formal system of mainstream cinema.</li>
<li><strong>→ [Delimits] → ◻ CONTEXT BOUNDARY:</strong> Focuses on the "male gaze" as the structuring principle of visual pleasure in classical narrative film, analyzing how the female figure is positioned as object.</li>
<li><strong>→ [Generates] → ◻ SAMPLING LATTICE:</strong> Analysis of typical Hollywood narrative structures, representations of female stars (e.g., Hitchcock blondes), conventions of looking (shot/reverse shot identifying with male gaze).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>→ [Manifests As] → ◻ PHENOMENON:</strong> The Male Gaze &amp; Patriarchal Visual Pleasure – Mainstream cinema operates according to an unconscious patriarchal order, structuring visual pleasure around the "male gaze." This involves scopophilia (pleasure in looking at the female figure as erotic object) and narcissistic identification (pleasure in identifying with the male protagonist who controls the gaze and narrative action). The female image often evokes castration anxiety, managed through fetishization or voyeuristic punishment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>◻ ENGINE:</strong> Psychoanalytic Feminist Film Analysis.<ul>
<li><strong>→ [Applies] → ◻ TRANSFORM:</strong> Decoding cinematic conventions and narrative structures as manifestations of unconscious patriarchal desires and mechanisms for producing gendered visual pleasure.<ul>
<li><strong>→ [Operates On] → ◻ PATCH:</strong> Specific film scenes, camera techniques, narrative patterns, character representations.</li>
<li><strong>→ [Produces] → ◻ INVARIANT:</strong> The concept of the "male gaze"; the mechanisms of scopophilia and narcissistic identification in cinema; the link between cinematic form and patriarchal ideology.</li>
<li><strong>→ [Requires] → ◻ CONTRACTION:</strong> Abstracting from individual film variations to the underlying psychoanalytic structure assumed to be operative.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>→ [Constructs] → ◻ REPRESENTATION:</strong> A powerful, albeit controversial, model explaining the ideological function of visual pleasure in mainstream cinema. A call for an alternative "counter-cinema."</li>
<li><strong>→ [Optimizes] → ◻ RECURSION:</strong> Applying the male gaze analysis to different genres and examples of classical cinema.<ul>
<li><strong>→ [Embeds] → ◻ MODEL:</strong> Freudian and Lacanian psychoanalysis (scopophilia, mirror stage, phallocentrism, castration complex), feminist critique of patriarchy.</li>
<li><strong>→ [Projects] → ◻ METRIC:</strong> Degree of female objectification, dominance of male POV, mechanisms for managing the female image (qualitative/structural).</li>
<li><strong>→ [Seeks] → ◻ FIXED POINT:</strong> Exposing the patriarchal unconscious of mainstream cinema and motivating the creation of alternative cinematic practices.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>◻ METAMODEL:</strong> Psychoanalytic Theory of Cinematic Ideology. Governs the analysis of film form as psychic structure. Binds Psychoanalytic Concepts (Gaze, Desire, Unconscious) DOMAIN ↔ Cinematic Conventions/Visual Pleasure CODMAIN.</li>
<li><strong>Distinctions &amp; Crossings:</strong><ul>
<li><code>◻ MODEL (Psychoanalytic structure/Male Gaze) | ◻ REALITY (Complex film viewing experiences, diverse audiences)</code> → <code>◻ MEASUREMENT ARTIFACT</code> (The theory's focus on a monolithic male gaze can be seen as an artifact potentially obscuring female spectatorship or other viewing positions, a point debated later).</li>
<li><code>◻ TIME-LIKE (Narrative progression controlled by male character) | ◻ SPACE-LIKE (Female body displayed as spectacle within the frame)</code>. The male gaze controls time (narrative) and objectifies space (female image).</li>
<li><code>◻ CONTINUOUS (Flow of the film) | ◻ DISCRETE (Shots, edits, moments of spectacle)</code> → <code>◻ SAMPLING THRESHOLD</code> (The analysis dissects the continuous film into discrete units revealing the operation of the gaze).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Operations:</strong> <code>Observe</code> cinematic conventions. <code>Encode</code> them using psychoanalytic concepts related to the gaze and desire. <code>Convolve</code> female image (<code>PATCH</code>) with cinematic techniques (<code>KERNEL</code>) to produce objectification (<code>FEATURE</code>). <code>Entangle</code> visual pleasure (<code>FEATURE</code>) with patriarchal ideology (<code>FEATURE</code>). Intentionally <code>Forget</code>s pre-feminist interpretations of pleasure.</li>
