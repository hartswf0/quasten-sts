# A Spencer-Brown Inspired Ontological Model of Seaver's "Algorithms as Culture"

This report presents a structured ontological index of Nick Seaver's influential 2017 article "Algorithms as Culture: Some Tactics for the Ethnography of Algorithmic Systems" using Spencer-Brown's calculus of distinctions. By marking entities as distinctions (◻) and relationships as indications (→), we create a formal representation that illuminates the conceptual architecture of Seaver's approach to algorithmic ethnography.

## Foundational Entities and Primary Distinctions

### Core Theoretical Constructs

◻ **Algorithms as culture**: Seaver's approach viewing algorithms as part of broad patterns of meaning and practice

◻ **algorithm**: Concept under debate with differing definitions across disciplines

◻ **multiples**: Unstable objects enacted through varied practices that engage with them

◻ **ethnographic enactment**: Approach to studying algorithms through ethnographic methods

◻ **algorithmic systems**: Heterogeneous and diffuse sociotechnical assemblages

◻ **terminological anxiety**: Concern about proper definition and use of the term "algorithm"

◻ **critical algorithm studies**: Transdisciplinary field applying humanistic and social scientific approaches to algorithms

### Contrasting Approaches to Algorithms

◻ **algorithms in culture**: View that algorithms are discrete objects that may be located within cultural contexts

◻ **algorithms as culture**: View that algorithms are unstable objects enacted through practices

◻ **computer science definition**: Algorithm as abstract, formalized description of a computational procedure

◻ **ethnographic definition**: Algorithm as heterogeneous sociotechnical system

◻ **charismatic mega-algorithms**: Complex systems like Google search that differ from simple algorithms like bubble sort

## Morphisms and Relational Structures

### Foundational Relationships

◻ **algorithms in culture** → *distinguishes between* → ◻ **algorithms and culture**
   *"They may shape culture and be shaped by culture, but this relationship is like that of a rock and the stream it is sitting in"*[5]

◻ **algorithms as culture** → *considers* → ◻ **algorithms as part of cultural practices**
   *"Algorithms are not technical rocks in a cultural stream, but are rather just more water"*[5]

◻ **multiples** → *are enacted through* → ◻ **varied practices**
   *"Unstable objects that are enacted through the varied practices that people use to engage with them"*[5][11]

◻ **critical algorithm studies** → *examines* → ◻ **algorithmic systems**
   *"The application of humanistic and social scientific approaches to algorithms"*[5]

### Disciplinary Framework

◻ **computer scientists** → *enact* → ◻ **algorithms as conceptual objects**
   *"Computer scientists enact algorithms as conceptual objects indifferent to implementation details"*[5][11]

◻ **critical scholars** → *enact* → ◻ **algorithms as closed boxes to be opened**
   *"While calls for accountability enact algorithms as closed boxes to be opened"*[5][11]

◻ **ethnographers** → *can enact* → ◻ **algorithms as sociotechnical systems**
   *"Critical researchers might seek to enact algorithms ethnographically, seeing them as heterogeneous and diffuse sociotechnical systems"*[5][11]

◻ **terminology** → *becomes* → ◻ **site of disciplinary anxiety**
   *"Already, one of the field's central tensions was evident: Did these humanists and social scientists, taking on objects that had, until recently, been the domain of computer scientists, know what they were talking about?"*[5]

## Complex Conceptual Structures

### Ethnographic Tactics Framework

◻ **ethnographic tactics** → *include* → ◻ **scavenging**
   *"A set of practical tactics for the ethnographic enactment of algorithmic systems"*[1][5][11]

◻ **ethnographic tactics** → *include* → ◻ **attending to the texture of access**
   *"Attend to the texture of access"*[5]

◻ **ethnographic tactics** → *include* → ◻ **treating interviews as fieldwork**
   *"Treat interviews as fieldwork"*[5]

◻ **ethnographic tactics** → *include* → ◻ **parsing corporate heteroglossia**
   *"Parse corporate heteroglossia"*[5]

◻ **ethnographic tactics** → *include* → ◻ **being wary of irony**
   *"Beware irony"*[5]

### Algorithmic Enactment Framework

◻ **algorithms** → *are enacted through* → ◻ **outsider research practices**
   *"Unstable objects that are enacted through the varied practices that people use to engage with them, including the practices of 'outsider' researchers"*[5][11]

◻ **differing enactments** → *foreground* → ◻ **different issues**
   *"Different ways of enacting algorithms foreground certain issues while occluding others"*[5][11]

◻ **algorithms** → *are perceived as* → ◻ **"modern myth"**
   *"Algorithms were 'somewhat of a modern myth,' attributed with great significance and power, but with ill-defined properties"*[5]

### Methodological Framework

◻ **ethnographic approach** → *does not require* → ◻ **pinning down a singular algorithm**
   *"Does not depend on pinning down a singular 'algorithm' or achieving 'access'"*[1][11]

◻ **ethnographic approach** → *works from* → ◻ **partial and mobile position**
   *"Work from the partial and mobile position of an outsider"*[1][11]

◻ **ethnographic approach** → *rejects* → ◻ **secrecy as defining feature**
   *"Where many methods for critically engaging algorithms take secrecy as one of algorithms' defining features, I try here to offer paths away from secrecy"*[5]

## Conceptual Applications

### Microsoft Bing Case Study

◻ **Bing search engine** → *runs* → ◻ **50 experiments simultaneously**
   *"At any moment, the engineers working on Bing are running about 50 of these experiments"*[7]

◻ **users** → *are part of* → ◻ **10 different experiments during a visit**
   *"In a given visit to Bing, a user will be part of around ten different experiments"*[7]

◻ **A/B tests** → *result in* → ◻ **no singular "Bing"**
   *"As a result of these experiments, there is no one 'Bing' to speak of"*[7]

### Cultural Implications

◻ **engineers** → *have incomplete understanding of* → ◻ **systems they create**
   *"In assuming that engineers have complete understanding of the systems they create, we make a mistake"*[7]

◻ **algorithmic systems** → *are* → ◻ **works of collective authorship**
   *"These systems are works of collective authorship, made, maintained, and revised by many people with different goals at different times"*[7]

◻ **complex systems** → *produce* → ◻ **unpredictable outputs**
   *"Once these systems reach a certain level of complexity, their outputs can be difficult to predict precisely, even for those with technical know-how"*[7]

## Conclusion

This Spencer-Brown inspired ontological model captures the rich theoretical framework of Seaver's "Algorithms as Culture." Through formal distinctions (◻) and indications (→), we visualize how Seaver reconceptualizes algorithms not as technical objects separate from culture, but as unstable entities enacted through varied practices. The model highlights Seaver's methodological contribution: a set of ethnographic tactics for studying algorithmic systems that does not depend on insider access or singular definitions. This approach allows researchers to examine algorithms as heterogeneous sociotechnical systems embedded in cultural practices rather than as rigid computational procedures isolated from their contexts.
