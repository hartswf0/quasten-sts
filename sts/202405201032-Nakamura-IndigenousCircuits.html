    <p><strong>Focused Problem Statement:</strong></p>
    <p>Dominant histories of computing and digital technology (Level 3 Framing) typically focus on engineers, innovation hubs like Silicon Valley, and the seemingly immaterial aspects of software (Level 1 Model of progress). This narrative obscures the crucial material foundations of the industry, particularly the exploited, racialized, and gendered labor performed by marginalized groups like Navajo women in early semiconductor manufacturing (Level 0 Reality). By rendering this essential labor invisible, often justified through racist/sexist stereotypes like "nimble fingers" (Level 2 Management Discourse), these histories perpetuate a flawed understanding of technological development and uphold colonial and capitalist logics (Level 4 Systemic Obscuring).</p>

    <p>Nakamura, L. (2014). Indigenous circuits: Navajo women and the racialization of early electronic manufacture. American Quarterly, 66(4), 919–941.</p>

    <p>MODEL: Uncovers the hidden history of Navajo women's labor in the early US semiconductor industry, arguing their highly skilled work was racialized and gendered as "nimble fingers" dexterity, naturalizing their exploitation and contributing to the material production of digital technologies while remaining largely invisible.</p>
