    <p><strong>Reference:</strong> Turkle, Sherry - The Second Self: Computers and the Human Spirit (2005/1984)</p>

    <p><strong>Focused Problem Statement:</strong></p>
    <p>Early perspectives on computers often viewed them merely as instrumental tools for calculation or information processing (Level 1 Model: Computer as Tool). This functionalist framing (Level 3) obscured the profound psychological impact computers have as "evocative objects," particularly during the rise of personal computing. By engaging users (especially children) in interaction that simulates thought, agency, and rule-based worlds (Level 1 Simulation), computers act as a "second self," prompting deep reflection on fundamental questions about life, mind, and identity (Level 0 Reality of Self), reshaping subjectivity in ways ignored by purely technical accounts (Level 2 Experience, Level 4 Obscuring Psychological Dimension).</p>

    <p>Turkle, S. (2005). The second self: Computers and the human spirit (20th anniversary ed.). MIT Press. (Original 1984)</p>

    <p>MODEL: Examines the psychological impact of computers on users, particularly how interacting with computers influences people's sense of self, identity, and their understanding of what it means to be human, think, and feel, exploring the computer as a "second self" or evocative object.</p>
