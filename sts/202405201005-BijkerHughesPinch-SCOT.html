    <p><strong>Reference:</strong> Bijker, Wiebe E., Thomas P. Hughes, and Trevor Pinch - The Social Construction of Technological Systems (SCOT Chapter 1) (1989)</p>

    <p><strong>Focused Problem Statement:</strong></p>
    <p>Linear or technologically determinist accounts of innovation (Level 3 Framing) present the development of successful technologies (Level 1 Artifact) as an inevitable progression towards an optimal solution for a pre-defined problem (Level 0 Implied Need). This obscures the crucial period of "interpretive flexibility" where different "relevant social groups" (Level 2 Users/Actors) define the artifact's problems and meanings differently, leading to contested designs. The eventual "closure" around a dominant design is thus masked as technical superiority rather than the outcome of social negotiation and power dynamics (Level 4 Logic: Determinism).</p>

    <p>MODEL: Introduces the Social Construction of Technology (SCOT) approach, arguing that technological development is not linear or inevitable but is shaped by the interpretations and negotiations of "relevant social groups," involving "interpretative flexibility" until "closure" is reached around a dominant design or meaning.</p>
