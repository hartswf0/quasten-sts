    <p><strong>Reference:</strong> Layne, Linda; Vostral, Sharra; Boyer, Kate (Eds.) - Feminist Technology (2010)</p>

    <p><strong>Focused Problem Statement:</strong></p>
    <p>Technological design and development processes often proceed under an implicit assumption of a universal, unmarked (typically male, white, able-bodied) user (Level 1 Model Simulation). This "neutral" framing (Level 3 Framing) obscures how specific design choices, material properties, and embedded assumptions actively reflect and reinforce existing gender hierarchies and stereotypes (Level 4 Logic). Consequently, technologies frequently fail to meet the needs of women and other marginalized genders, perpetuate harmful biases, or reshape gendered experiences and power relations in problematic ways (Level 0 Reality affected, Level 2 User Experience), problems that feminist analysis seeks to uncover and address.</p>

    <p>Layne, L., Vostral, S., & Boyer, K. (Eds.). (2010). Feminist technology. University of Illinois Press.</p>

    <p>MODEL: Collects essays showcasing feminist approaches to technology, emphasizing how gender shapes the design, use, and interpretation of technologies, and conversely, how technologies shape gender identities and relations; advocates for analyses attentive to power, embodiment, and diverse user experiences.</p>
