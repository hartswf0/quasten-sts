    <p><strong>Reference:</strong> Tsing, Anna - The Mushroom at the End of the World (2015)</p>

    <p><strong>Focused Problem Statement:</strong></p>
    <p>Standard models of global capitalism and supply chains (Level 1 Models) often portray a homogenizing force expanding into pristine nature or driving linear progress (Level 3 Framing). This obscures the reality of contemporary capitalism operating through <strong>"salvage accumulation"</strong>: profiting from patchy, precarious landscapes ruined by prior capitalist activity (Level 0 Reality). By following the matsutake mushroom, Tsing reveals how value chains depend on contingent, multispecies collaborations (human pickers, fungi, trees, traders - Level 2 Practices) within these disturbed ecosystems, highlighting forms of precarious life and non-scalable interconnection ignored by dominant economic narratives (Level 4 Logic: Obscuring Ruin & Collaboration).</p>

    <p>Tsing, A. (2015). The mushroom at the end of the world. Princeton University Press.</p>

    <p>MODEL: Explores the global commodity chain of the matsutake mushroom, using it as a lens to examine life and economic activity within capitalist ruins (the Anthropocene); highlights themes of precarity, salvage accumulation, collaboration across species and cultures, and the possibilities of survival in disturbed landscapes.</p>
