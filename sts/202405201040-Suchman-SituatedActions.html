    <p><strong>Focused Problem Statement:</strong></p>
    <p>Cognitive science and Artificial Intelligence design often model human purposeful behavior based on pre-formulated, internal plans (Level 1 Model: Plan-Based Action). This framework obscures the reality that human action is fundamentally <strong>situated</strong>: emerging dynamically and resourcefully in response to the specific, unfolding contingencies of the material and social environment (Level 0 Reality). Systems designed based on the planning model (e.g., complex interfaces, early AI) frequently lead to interactional breakdowns because they cannot account for the user's situated interpretations and improvisations (Level 2 Use). This highlights a flawed underlying assumption about cognition (Level 4 Logic) critiqued by Suchman's interaction analysis (Level 3 Framing).</p>

    <p>MODEL: Critiques traditional AI and cognitive science views of planning, arguing through ethnographic analysis of people using complex machines (like photocopiers) that human action is fundamentally "situated"—responsive to the emergent contingencies of the situation—rather than driven by pre-formed plans; explores implications for human-computer interaction design.</p>
