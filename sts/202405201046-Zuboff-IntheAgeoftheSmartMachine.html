    <p><strong>Reference:</strong> Zuboff, Shoshana - In the Age of the Smart Machine: The Future of Work and Power (1988)</p>

    <p><strong>Focused Problem Statement:</strong></p>
    <p>The implementation of information technology (IT) in workplaces is often framed simply as "automation" aimed at efficiency (Level 1 Model: Automation Focus; Level 3 Framing). This obscures a fundamental strategic choice: IT can either primarily <strong>Automate</strong> (deskilling labor, centralizing control, increasing surveillance) OR <strong>Informate</strong> (making processes transparent, generating new insights, requiring new "intellective skills" from workers). The focus on automation masks the potential of IT to empower workers through information (Level 0 Potential) and hides the power struggles (Level 2 Management vs. Labor) influencing which path is chosen, ultimately shaping the future of work, knowledge, and authority within organizations (Level 4 Logic: Obscuring the Automate/Informate Choice).</p>

    <p>Zuboff, S. (1988). In the age of the smart machine: The future of work and power. Basic Books, Inc.</p>

    <p>MODEL: Analyzes the impact of information technology on work and organizations, introducing the concepts of "automating" (using tech to replace human labor) versus "informating" (using tech to generate new information and empower workers); highlights the power struggles and choices involved in technological implementation and its consequences for skills, surveillance, and authority. (Precursor to her later work on surveillance capitalism).</p>
