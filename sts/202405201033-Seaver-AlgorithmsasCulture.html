    <p><strong>Reference:</strong> Seaver, Nick - Algorithms as Culture: Some Tactics for the Ethnography of Algorithmic Systems (2017)</p>

    <p><strong>Focused Problem Statement:</strong></p>
    <p>Analyses of algorithmic systems (e.g., music recommendation - Level 1 Machine) often treat them solely as technical objects performing objective functions (calculating similarity, predicting preference - Level 3 Technical Framing). This obscures the crucial way algorithms function *as culture*: they are embedded within and shape webs of human meaning-making, interpretation, and practice (Level 0 Reality). Both developers and users create "folk theories" to understand and interact with these systems (Level 2 Use/Interpretation), and the algorithms themselves embody cultural assumptions. Focusing only on technical function ignores this vital cultural dimension (Level 4 Obscuring) and hinders a full understanding of how algorithms operate in the world.</p>

    <p>Seaver, N. (2017). Algorithms as culture: Some tactics for the ethnography of algorithmic systems. Big Data & Society, 4(2).</p>

    <p>MODEL: Proposes conceptualizing algorithms not just as technical objects but as "culture," arguing for ethnographic approaches to study them; suggests tactics like "studying sideways" (examining adjacent practices) and "following the engineers" to understand how algorithms are made meaningful and embedded in social life.</p>
