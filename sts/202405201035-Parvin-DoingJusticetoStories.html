    <p><strong>Reference:</strong> Parvin, Nassim - Doing Justice to Stories: On Ethics and Politics of Digital Storytelling (2018)</p>

    <p><strong>Focused Problem Statement:</strong></p>
    <p>Digital storytelling projects, especially those involving vulnerable individuals, often focus on the technical production or potential positive impact of sharing stories (Level 1 Tool/Output; Level 3 Empowerment Framing). This can obscure the complex ethical responsibilities and power dynamics inherent in mediating and circulating personal narratives (Level 0 Lived Experience). Without careful attention to "doing justice" – considering consent contextually, representational fairness, ownership, potential harm from circulation, and storyteller agency (Level 2 Relations neglected) – these projects risk exploiting participants or causing unintended harm, hidden by a focus on technology or simplistic notions of 'giving voice' (Level 4 Logic: Obscuring Power Dynamics).</p>
    <h2>1. Core Model and Index</h2>

    <p>Parvin, N. (2018). Doing justice to stories: On ethics and politics of digital storytelling. Engaging Science, Technology, and Society, 4, 515–534.</p>

    <p>MODEL: Explores the ethical and political dimensions of digital storytelling, particularly when involving vulnerable or marginalized communities, arguing for practices that "do justice" to stories by considering issues of representation, consent, ownership, context, and the potential impact of circulation.</p>
