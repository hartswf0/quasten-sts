    <p><strong>Reference:</strong> Stengers, Isabelle - Power and Invention (1997)</p>

    <p><strong>Focused Problem Statement:</strong></p>
    <p>Modern science often operates with a claim to universal validity and authority (Level 3 Framing), using its methods and criteria (Level 1 Scientific Model) to judge and frequently disqualify or "capture" other forms of knowledge-making (e.g., clinical, artisanal, activist - Level 0 Diverse Realities/Practices). This exercise of epistemic power obscures the specific, situated requirements and potential validity of these other practices (Level 2 Practice Ignored). It hinders genuine invention, which Stengers argues often arises from risky, respectful encounters ("diplomacy") within an "ecology of practices" where different modes of knowing can challenge and enrich each other without premature disqualification based on a single dominant logic (Level 4 Logic: Scientific Hegemony).</p>
    <h2>1. Core Model and Index</h2>

    <p>Stengers, I. (1997). Power and invention. University of Minnesota Press.</p>

    <p>MODEL: Critiques the power dynamics inherent in modern science that often stifle invention and alternative ways of knowing; advocates for an "ecology of practices" where different knowledge forms can coexist and interact creatively, emphasizing slowing down scientific processes to allow for more careful, situated, and inventive thought.</p>
