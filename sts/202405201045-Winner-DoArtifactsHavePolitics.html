    <p><strong>Reference:</strong> Winner, Langdon - Do Artifacts Have Politics? (1980)</p>

    <p><strong>Focused Problem Statement:</strong></p>
    <p>Conventional thinking often treats technological artifacts as neutral tools, evaluating them solely based on efficiency or function (Level 1 Functional Model; Level 3 Neutrality Framing). This obscures the ways artifacts can embody and enact political values, either through intentional design choices aimed at achieving specific social outcomes (e.g., exclusion) or because their inherent properties are more compatible with certain political structures (Level 0 Socio-Political Reality shaped). By ignoring the politics *within* artifacts, we fail to recognize technologies as significant forces shaping power relations and social order (Level 2 Experience of effects; Level 4 Obscuring Politics).</p>
    <h2>1. Core Model and Index</h2>

    <p>Winner, L. (1980). Do artifacts have politics? Daedalus, 109(1), 121–136.</p>

    <p>MODEL: Argues forcefully that technological artifacts can embody political properties in two ways: either by design to produce a specific social outcome (e.g., low bridges restricting bus access) or by being inherently compatible with certain political systems (e.g., nuclear power requiring centralized control).</p>
