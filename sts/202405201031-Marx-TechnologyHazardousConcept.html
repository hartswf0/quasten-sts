    <p>title: Marx - Technology Hazardous Concept (Analysis)</p>
    <p>tags: <span class="olog-relation">[sts, history-technology, language, concepts, reification, determinism, critique, olog-analysis]</span></p>

    <p><strong>Reference:</strong> Marx, Leo - Technology: The Emergence of a Hazardous Concept (2010)</p>

    <p><strong>Focused Problem Statement:</strong></p>
    <p>Contemporary discourse frequently employs "Technology" as an abstract, reified noun (Level 1 Conceptual Model), treating it as an autonomous force driving social change. This linguistic practice (Level 2 Use) obscures the concrete realities of specific tools, techniques, knowledge systems, and especially the human agents, social choices, political economies, and cultural values that shape their development and deployment (Level 0 Reality). The hazard (Level 3 Critique) lies in how this powerful abstraction (Level 4 Logic: Reification) fosters technological determinism, masks agency and responsibility, and hinders nuanced discussion about the actual socio-material processes involved.</p>
    <h2>1. Core Model and Index</h2>

    <p>Marx, L. (2010). Technology: The emergence of a hazardous concept. Technology and Culture, 51(3), 561–577.</p>

    <p>MODEL: Traces the historical emergence and semantic shift of the word "technology," arguing it evolved from referring to practical arts to representing a powerful, reified, and often autonomous force in society, making the concept itself potentially "hazardous" by obscuring human agency and social context.</p>
