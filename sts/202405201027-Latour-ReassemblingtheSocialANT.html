    <p><strong>Focused Problem Statement:</strong></p>
    <p>Traditional sociology often invokes pre-existing social structures, forces, or categories (e.g., 'class', 'society', 'gender' - Level 1 Models or Level 4 Logic) to explain human actions (Level 0 Reality). This obscures the practical, ongoing, and contingent work that heterogeneous actors (human and non-human) perform (Level 2 Practice) through processes of "translation" (redefining interests/identities) and mediation (via artifacts) to *assemble* temporary and reversible associations. ANT (Level 3 Framing) proposes shifting from explaining action *by* the social to describing *how* the social is assembled *through* these actor-network formations, thus avoiding premature explanations that hide the actual work of association.</p>

    <p>MODEL: Introduces Actor-Network Theory (ANT) not as a theory of the social, but a method for tracing associations; argues the "social" should be understood as dynamic networks of heterogeneous actors (both human and non-human) constantly being assembled and reassembled through processes of translation and enrollment.</p>
