    <p><strong>Reference:</strong> Haraway, Donna - Staying With the Trouble (2016)</p>

    <p><strong>Focused Problem Statement:</strong></p>
    <p>Dominant narratives of the Anthropocene (often framed as either techno-optimist salvation or apocalyptic despair - Level 3 Framing) rely on models of human exceptionalism and control (Level 1 Models) that obscure the complex, messy, ongoing reality of multispecies entanglement, co-dependence, and shared vulnerability within damaged ecosystems (Level 0 Reality). By focusing on grand narratives and human agency alone, these frameworks mask the importance of situated, relational practices of "staying with the trouble" – cultivating "response-ability," "making kin," and fostering modest flourishing through "sympoiesis" (co-making) with diverse human and non-human others (Level 2 Practice neglected, Level 4 Logic critiqued).</p>

    <p>Haraway, D. (2016). Staying with the trouble. Duke University Press.</p>

    <p>MODEL: Advocates for "staying with the trouble" of living and dying well together in complex, damaged worlds (the Chthulucene), emphasizing multispecies entanglements, response-ability, situated knowledge, and speculative fabulation (SF) as ways to cultivate care and flourishing amidst ongoing ecological and social crises, rejecting easy solutions or apocalyptic narratives.</p>
