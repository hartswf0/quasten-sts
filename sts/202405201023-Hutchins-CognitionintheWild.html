    <p><strong>Reference:</strong> Hutchins, Edwin - Cognition in the Wild (1996)</p>

    <p><strong>Focused Problem Statement:</strong></p>
    <p>Traditional cognitive science (Level 3 Framing) predominantly models cognition as an individual, internal process residing solely within the human mind (Level 1 Model: "Mind = Brain"). This obscures the fundamental ways complex cognitive tasks, such as ship navigation (Level 0 Reality), are actually accomplished through <strong>distributed cognitive systems</strong> involving interaction between multiple people, external artifacts (charts, tools), environmental structures, and culturally transmitted procedures (Level 2 Use/Practice). By focusing only on the individual, this framework fails to recognize the system-level computation and the crucial cognitive functions performed by non-mental elements (Level 4 Logic: Methodological Individualism).</p>
    <h2>1. Core Model and Index</h2>

    <p>Hutchins, E. (1996). Cognition in the wild. MIT Press.</p>

    <p>MODEL: Argues that cognition is not solely an individual, internal process but is fundamentally "distributed" across individuals, artifacts, and the environment within socio-cultural systems. Uses detailed ethnographic analysis of ship navigation to show how cognitive tasks are accomplished collectively through interaction within a complex system.</p>
