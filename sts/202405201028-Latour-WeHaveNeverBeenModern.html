    <p><strong>Reference:</strong> Latour, Bruno - We Have Never Been Modern (1993)</p>

    <p><strong>Focused Problem Statement:</strong></p>
    <p>The intellectual framework of Modernity (the "Modern Constitution" - Level 1 Model) is built upon a fundamental, enforced separation between Nature (studied by science) and Society/Culture (governed by politics). This act of "Purification" (Level 4 Logic) presents a clean division that obscures the simultaneous and accelerating practice of "Translation" – the creation of vast networks of Nature-Culture hybrids (technologies, environmental problems, socio-technical systems - Level 0 Reality). By denying the existence and proliferation of these hybrids (Level 2 Practice), the Modern framework prevents us from adequately understanding or governing our world, leading to crises born from this contradiction (Level 3 Critique by Latour).</p>
    <h2>1. Core Model and Index</h2>

    <p>Latour, B. (1993). We have never been modern. Harvard University Press.</p>

    <p>MODEL: Critiques the foundational "modern constitution" that separates Nature and Society (and non-humans from humans) through acts of "purification," while simultaneously creating ever more hybrid networks ("translation") that mix them; argues we must abandon this false dichotomy to understand our world.</p>
