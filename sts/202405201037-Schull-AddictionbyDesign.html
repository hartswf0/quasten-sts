    <p><strong>Reference:</strong> Schull, Natasha Dow - Addiction by Design (2012) / Digital Gambling (2005)</p>

    <p><strong>Focused Problem Statement:</strong></p>
    <p>Discourses around gambling addiction often focus on individual pathology or moral failure (Level 3 Framing). This obscures the crucial role of technological design, where Electronic Gambling Machines (EGMs - Level 1 Machine) are meticulously engineered to induce and maintain addictive states of play ("the zone"). By optimizing for continuous interaction and exploiting psychological vulnerabilities through specific design features (Level 1 Filters/Outputs), the industry creates a powerful human-machine loop (Level 2 Experience) that maximizes "time-on-device" and revenue, effectively designing addiction itself while framing the activity as mere entertainment or individual choice (Level 4 Logic: Obscuring Design's Agency).</p>

    <p>MODEL: Analyzes how digital gambling machines (like video poker) are meticulously designed to foster addiction by creating a state of continuous, captivating flow (the "zone"), where the interaction between player desire and machine design creates a powerful feedback loop that maximizes "time on device."</p>
