    <p><strong>Reference:</strong> Harding, Sandra - Rethinking Standpoint Epistemology: What is 'Strong Objectivity?' (1992)</p>

    <p><strong>Focused Problem Statement:</strong></p>
    <p>Traditional ideals of scientific objectivity ("weak objectivity" - Level 1 Model) equate rigor with value-neutrality and detachment, obscuring how this very stance often masks the unexamined biases and situated perspectives of dominant social groups (e.g., white, male, Western - Level 4 Logic). By failing to require critical reflection on the researcher's own social location, this model prevents the identification of systemic biases shaping research agendas and interpretations (Level 0 Reality misrepresented). Harding argues this framework actively hinders the achievement of a more robust "strong objectivity" (Level 3 Reframing), which emerges precisely from starting research from marginalized lives (Level 2 Practice) and demanding critical reflexivity about all standpoints.</p>
    <h2>1. Core Model and Index</h2>

    <p>Harding, S. (1992). Rethinking standpoint epistemology: What is 'strong objectivity'? The Centennial Review, 36(3), 437–470.</p>

    <p>MODEL: Defends and refines standpoint epistemology, arguing that knowledge generated from the perspectives of marginalized groups, because it must understand both dominant and marginalized views, can offer a more robust or "strong objectivity" compared to supposedly neutral viewpoints that ignore power relations and their own situatedness.</p>
