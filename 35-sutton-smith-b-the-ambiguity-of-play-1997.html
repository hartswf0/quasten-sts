<h2>1. Problem Statement</h2>
<ol>
<li>Sutton-Smith, B. - The Ambiguity of Play (1997)</li>
</ol>
<p>Focused Problem Statement: Attempts to definitively label children's 'screen time' (L0 Reality) as either 'good' (educational) or 'bad' (harmful) obscure the inherent ambiguity of play highlighted by Sutton-Smith (L3 Framing). Analyzing online parenting forum discussions (L2 User Discourse) reveals conflicting 'rhetorics of play' (L1 Discourses) being deployed, reflecting latent cultural anxieties (L4) rather than a clear understanding of the play activity itself.</p>
<h2>2. Core Model</h2>
<p><strong>35. Sutton-Smith, B. - The Ambiguity of Play (1997)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>MODEL:</strong> Challenges simplistic definitions of play by exploring its inherent ambiguities and contradictions. Argues that play is associated with multiple, often conflicting, cultural meanings and functions ("rhetorics of play" – e.g., play as progress, fate, power, identity, frivolity), reflecting its complex role in human life.</li>

<li><strong>→ [Delimits] → ◻ CONTEXT BOUNDARY:</strong> Resists single, unified definition of play, instead emphasizes its inherent ambiguity and the multiple, often conflicting, ways it is framed culturally.</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>→ [Manifests As] → ◻ PHENOMENON:</strong> The Ambiguity of Play &amp; Its Rhetorics – Play is not a unitary phenomenon with a single function but an inherently ambiguous category associated with multiple, sometimes contradictory, cultural meanings and justifications ("rhetorics"). Understanding play requires acknowledging this variability and the ideological work done by different ways of talking about it.</li>

<li><strong>→ [Optimizes] → ◻ RECURSION:</strong> Applying the rhetorical analysis to different historical periods, cultures, and types of play.<ul>

<li><strong>→ [Projects] → ◻ METRIC:</strong> Identification of dominant rhetoric, degree of ambiguity acknowledged, ideological function of the rhetoric (qualitative/analytical).</li>
<li><strong>→ [Seeks] → ◻ FIXED POINT:</strong> Acceptance of play's fundamental ambiguity and the importance of analyzing its varied cultural rhetorics.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>◻ METAMODEL:</strong> Theory of Play Rhetorics. Governs the analysis of discourses surrounding play. Binds Play Activities/Forms DOMAIN ↔ Cultural Interpretations/Valuations (Rhetorics) CODMAIN.</li>
<li><strong>Distinctions &amp; Crossings:</strong><ul>
<li><code>◻ MODEL (Specific theories/rhetorics of play) | ◻ REALITY (Ambiguous, multifaceted phenomenon of play itself)</code> → <code>◻ MEASUREMENT ARTIFACT</code> (Each rhetoric/theory is shown to be a selective model, an artifact highlighting certain aspects of play while obscuring others due to its rhetorical purpose).</li>
<li><code>◻ TIME-LIKE (Developmental aspects of play, historical shifts in rhetorics) | ◻ SPACE-LIKE (Cultural variations in play forms and meanings)</code>. Examines both dimensions of play's variability.</li>
<li><code>◻ CONTINUOUS (Spectrum of playful behaviors) | ◻ DISCRETE (Identified rhetorics, specific games/activities)</code> → <code>◻ SAMPLING THRESHOLD</code> (Uses discrete analytical categories (rhetorics) to make sense of the continuous and ambiguous field of play).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Operations:</strong> <code>Observe</code> play and discourses about play. <code>Encode</code> discourses into distinct rhetorics. <code>Entangle</code> specific play forms (<code>FEATURE</code>) with the cultural valuations (<code>FEATURE</code>) embedded in their surrounding rhetorics.
