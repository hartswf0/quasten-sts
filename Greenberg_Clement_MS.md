# A Spencer-Brown Inspired Ontological Model of Greenberg's "Avant-Garde and Kitsch" and "Modernist Painting"

This report presents a structured ontological index of Clement Greenberg's influential essays "Avant-Garde and Kitsch" and "Modernist Painting" using Spencer-Brown's calculus of distinctions. By marking entities as distinctions (◻) and relationships as indications (→), we create a formal representation that illuminates the conceptual architecture of Greenberg's theory of modernism.

## Foundational Entities and Primary Distinctions

### Core Theoretical Constructs

◻ **Modernism**: Self-critical tendency covering "almost the whole of what is truly alive in our culture"[1]

◻ **Self-criticism**: Using methods of a discipline to criticize that discipline from within

◻ **Medium specificity**: Focus on properties unique to a particular artistic medium 

◻ **Flatness**: Essential property that distinguishes painting from other art forms

◻ **Purity**: State achieved when art eliminates all qualities not specific to its medium

◻ **Avant-garde**: Art that resists cultural degradation through formal innovation

◻ **Kitsch**: Mechanical, formulaic art producing "vicarious experience and faked sensations"[5]

### Historical Components

◻ **Kant**: Philosopher identified as "the first real Modernist" for criticizing the means of criticism[1]

◻ **Enlightenment**: Movement that criticized from outside rather than within[1]

◻ **Old Masters**: Traditional painters who "dissembled the medium, using art to conceal art"[1]

◻ **Manet**: Creator of "the first Modernist pictures" acknowledging flat surfaces[1]

◻ **Impressionists**: Artists who "abjured underpainting and glazes" to emphasize paint's materiality[1]

◻ **Cézanne**: Artist who "sacrificed verisimilitude" to fit design into rectangular canvas[1]

## Morphisms and Relational Structures

### Foundational Relationships

◻ **Modernism** → *uses* → ◻ **characteristic methods of a discipline to criticize itself**
   *"The essence of Modernism lies, as I see it, in the use of characteristic methods of a discipline to criticise the discipline itself"*[1]

◻ **Self-criticism** → *entrenches art in* → ◻ **area of competence**
   *"Not in order to subvert it but in order to entrench it more firmly in its area of competence"*[1]

◻ **Avant-garde** → *creates art with* → ◻ **intrinsic value**
   *"The arts could save themselves from this leveling down only by demonstrating that the kind of experience they provided was valuable in its own right"*[1]

◻ **Modernist painting** → *calls attention to* → ◻ **art itself**
   *"Modernism used art to call attention to art"*[1]

### Medium and Purity Framework

◻ **Each art** → *must determine* → ◻ **effects exclusive to itself**
   *"Each art had to determine, through its own operations and works, the effects exclusive to itself"*[1]

◻ **Self-criticism** → *eliminates* → ◻ **effects borrowed from other media**
   *"The task of self-criticism became to eliminate from the specific effects of each art any and every effect that might conceivably be borrowed from or by the medium of any other art"*[1]

◻ **Medium specificity** → *leads to* → ◻ **purity**
   *"Thus would each art be rendered 'pure,' and in its 'purity' find the guarantee of its standard of quality as well as of its independence"*[1]

◻ **Painting** → *claims* → ◻ **flatness as unique property**
   *"Because flatness was the only condition painting shared with no other art, Modernist painting oriented itself to flatness as it did to nothing else"*[1]

## Complex Conceptual Structures

### Painting's Historical Development Framework

◻ **Old Masters** → *preserved* → ◻ **integrity of picture plane beneath illusion**
   *"The Old Masters had sensed that it was necessary to preserve what is called the integrity of the picture plane"*[1]

◻ **Modernists** → *reverse terms of* → ◻ **this contradiction**
   *"The Modernists have neither avoided nor resolved this contradiction; rather they have reversed its terms"*[1]

◻ **Pre-Modernist painting** → *generates recognition of* → ◻ **content before medium**
   *"Whereas one tends to see what is in an Old Master before one sees the picture itself"*[1]

◻ **Modernist painting** → *generates recognition of* → ◻ **picture before content**
   *"One sees a Modernist picture as a picture first"*[1]

### Three-Dimensionality Framework

◻ **Representation** → *is not inherently* → ◻ **problematic for modernism**
   *"Modernist painting in its latest phase has not abandoned the representation of recognizable objects in principle"*[1]

◻ **Modernist painting** → *abandons* → ◻ **representation of three-dimensional space**
   *"What it has abandoned in principle is the representation of the kind of space that recognizable objects can inhabit"*[1]

◻ **Abstraction** → *is not necessarily* → ◻ **essential to modernist painting**
   *"Abstractness, or the non-figurative, has in itself still not proved to be an altogether necessary moment in the self-criticism of pictorial art"*[1]

◻ **Three-dimensionality** → *belongs to* → ◻ **domain of sculpture**
   *"Three-dimensionality is the province of sculpture"*[1]

## Avant-Garde and Kitsch Relationships

### Cultural Division Framework

◻ **Avant-garde** → *resists* → ◻ **degradation of culture**
   *"True avant-garde art is a product of the Enlightenment's revolution of critical thinking, and as such resists and recoils from the degradation of culture"*[5]

◻ **Kitsch** → *is* → ◻ **mechanical and formulaic**
   *"Kitsch is mechanical and operates by formulas"*[5]

◻ **Kitsch** → *produces* → ◻ **vicarious experience and faked sensations**
   *"Kitsch is vicarious experience and faked sensations"*[5]

◻ **Avant-garde** → *is too* → ◻ **innocent for propaganda**
   *"For Greenberg, avant-garde art was too 'innocent' to be effectively used as propaganda or bent to a cause"*[5]

## Conclusion

This Spencer-Brown inspired ontological model captures the rich theoretical framework of Greenberg's essays on Modernism and the avant-garde. Through formal distinctions (◻) and indications (→), we visualize how Greenberg conceptualized the self-critical nature of Modernism, the emphasis on medium specificity, and the central importance of flatness to modernist painting. The model highlights his influential claims about how modernist art reveals its own conditions of production while maintaining continuity with artistic tradition, ultimately showing that "Modernism has never meant, and does not mean now, anything like a break with the past"[1].
